The most well-known conjecture in the context of matroid secretary problems
claims the existence of a constant-factor approximation applicable to any
matroid. Whereas this conjecture remains open, modified forms of it were shown
to be true, when assuming that the assignment of weights to the secretaries is
not adversarial but uniformly random (Soto [SODA 2011], Oveis Gharan and
Vondr\'ak [ESA 2011]). However, so far, there was no variant of the matroid
secretary problem with adversarial weight assignment for which a
constant-factor approximation was found. We address this point by presenting a
9-approximation for the \emph{free order model}, a model suggested shortly
after the introduction of the matroid secretary problem, and for which no
constant-factor approximation was known so far. The free order model is a
relaxed version of the original matroid secretary problem, with the only
difference that one can choose the order in which secretaries are interviewed.
Furthermore, we consider the classical matroid secretary problem for the
special case of laminar matroids. Only recently, a constant-factor
approximation has been found for this case, using a clever but rather involved
method and analysis (Im and Wang, [SODA 2011]) that leads to a
16000/3-approximation. This is arguably the most involved special case of the
matroid secretary problem for which a constant-factor approximation is known.
We present a considerably simpler and stronger $3\sqrt{3}e\approx
14.12$-approximation, based on reducing the problem to a matroid secretary
problem on a partition matroid.
