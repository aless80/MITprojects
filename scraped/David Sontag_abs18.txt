Structured prediction tasks in machine learning involve the simultaneous
prediction of multiple labels. This is typically done by maximizing a score
function on the space of labels, which decomposes as a sum of pairwise
elements, each depending on two specific labels. Intuitively, the more pairwise
terms are used, the better the expected accuracy. However, there is currently
no theoretical account of this intuition. This paper takes a significant step
in this direction.
We formulate the problem as classifying the vertices of a known graph
$G=(V,E)$, where the vertices and edges of the graph are labelled and correlate
semi-randomly with the ground truth. We show that the prospects for achieving
low expected Hamming error depend on the structure of the graph $G$ in
interesting ways. For example, if $G$ is a very poor expander, like a path,
then large expected Hamming error is inevitable. Our main positive result shows
that, for a wide class of graphs including 2D grid graphs common in machine
vision applications, there is a polynomial-time algorithm with small and
information-theoretically near-optimal expected error. Our results provide a
first step toward a theoretical justification for the empirical success of the
efficient approximate inference algorithms that are used for structured
prediction in models where exact inference is intractable.
