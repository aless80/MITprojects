Database-backed applications are nearly ubiquitous in our daily lives.
Applications that make many small accesses to the database create two
challenges for developers: increased latency and wasted resources from numerous
network round trips. A well-known technique to improve transactional database
application performance is to convert part of the application into stored
procedures that are executed on the database server. Unfortunately, this
conversion is often difficult. In this paper we describe Pyxis, a system that
takes database-backed applications and automatically partitions their code into
two pieces, one of which is executed on the application server and the other on
the database server. Pyxis profiles the application and server loads,
statically analyzes the code's dependencies, and produces a partitioning that
minimizes the number of control transfers as well as the amount of data sent
during each transfer. Our experiments using TPC-C and TPC-W show that Pyxis is
able to generate partitions with up to 3x reduction in latency and 1.7x
improvement in throughput when compared to a traditional non-partitioned
implementation and has comparable performance to that of a custom stored
procedure implementation.
