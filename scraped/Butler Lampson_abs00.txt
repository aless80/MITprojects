In Programming by Example, a system attempts to infer a program from input
and output examples, generally by searching for a composition of certain base
functions. Performing a naive brute force search is infeasible for even mildly
involved tasks. We note that the examples themselves often present clues as to
which functions to compose, and how to rank the resulting programs. In text
processing, which is our domain of interest, clues arise from simple textual
features: for example, if parts of the input and output strings are
permutations of one another, this suggests that sorting may be useful. We
describe a system that learns the reliability of such clues, allowing for
faster search and a principled ranking over programs. Experiments on a
prototype of this system show that this learning scheme facilitates efficient
inference on a range of text processing tasks.
