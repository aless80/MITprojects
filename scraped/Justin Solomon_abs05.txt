We present a generalization of the bilateral filter that can be applied to
feature-preserving smoothing of signals on images, meshes, and other domains
within a single unified framework. Our discretization is competitive with
state-of-the-art smoothing techniques in terms of both accuracy and speed, is
easy to implement, and has parameters that are straightforward to understand.
Unlike previous bilateral filters developed for meshes and other irregular
domains, our construction reduces exactly to the image bilateral on rectangular
domains and comes with a rigorous foundation in both the smooth and discrete
settings. These guarantees allow us to construct unconditionally convergent
mean-shift schemes that handle a variety of extremely noisy signals. We also
apply our framework to geometric edge-preserving effects like feature
enhancement and show how it is related to local histogram techniques.
