Software synthesis is rapidly developing into an important research area with
vast potential for practical application. The SYNT Workshop on Synthesis aims
to bringing together researchers interested in synthesis to present both
ongoing and mature work on all aspects of automated synthesis and its
applications.
The second iteration of SYNT took place in Saint Petersburg, Russia, and was
co-located with the 25th International Conference on Computer Aided
Verification. The workshop included eleven presentations covering the full
scope of the emerging synthesis community, as well as a discussion lead by Swen
Jacobs on the organization of two new synthesis competitions focusing on
reactive synthesis and syntax-guided functional synthesis respectively.
