The results of experimental tests of a novel method for moving large (pyramid
construction size) stone blocks by rolling them are presented. The method is
implemented by tying 12 identical rods of appropriately chosen radius to the
faces of the block forming a rough dodecagon prism. Experiments using a 1,000
kg block show that it can be moved across level open ground with a dynamic
coefficient of friction of less than 0.06. This value is a factor of five lower
than that obtained for dragging the block, and the best values reported for
dragging by others, at 0.3. the results are more dramatic than those obtained
on smaller scale experiments on a 29.6 kg block, also reported here. For full
scale pyramid blocks, the wooden "rods" woudl need to be posts of order 30 cm
in diameter, similar in size to those used as masts on ships in the Nile.
