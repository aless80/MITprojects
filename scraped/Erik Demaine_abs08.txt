This paper proves that arrangement of music is NP-hard when subject to
various constraints: avoiding musical dissonance, limiting how many notes can
be played simultaneously, and limiting transition speed between chords. These
results imply the computational complexity of related musical problems,
including musical choreography and rhythm games.
