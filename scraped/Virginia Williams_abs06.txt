A recent and active line of work achieves tight lower bounds for fundamental
problems under the Strong Exponential Time Hypothesis (SETH). A celebrated
result of Backurs and Indyk (STOC'15) proves that the Edit Distance of two
sequences of length n cannot be computed in strongly subquadratic time under
SETH. The result was extended by follow-up works to simpler looking problems
like finding the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS).
SETH is a very strong assumption, asserting that even linear size CNF
formulas cannot be analyzed for satisfiability with an exponential speedup over
exhaustive search. We consider much safer assumptions, e.g. that such a speedup
is impossible for SAT on much more expressive representations, like NC
circuits. Intuitively, this seems much more plausible: NC circuits can
implement complex cryptographic primitives, while CNFs cannot even
approximately compute an XOR of bits.
Our main result is a surprising reduction from SAT on Branching Programs to
fundamental problems in P like Edit Distance, LCS, and many others. Truly
subquadratic algorithms for these problems therefore have consequences that we
consider to be far more remarkable than merely faster CNF SAT algorithms. For
example, SAT on arbitrary o(n)-depth bounded fan-in circuits (and therefore
also NC-Circuit-SAT) can be solved in (2-eps)^n time.
A very interesting feature of our work is that we can prove major
consequences even from mildly subquadratic algorithms for Edit Distance or LCS.
For example, we show that if we can shave an arbitrarily large polylog factor
from n^2 for Edit Distance then NEXP does not have non-uniform NC^1 circuits. A
more fine-grained examination shows that even shaving a $\log^c{n}$ factor, for
a specific constant $c \approx 10^3$, already implies new circuit lower bounds.
