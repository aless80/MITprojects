We consider the problem of static assortment optimization, where the goal is
to find the assortment of size at most $C$ that maximizes revenues. This is a
fundamental decision problem in the area of Operations Management. It has been
shown that this problem is provably hard for most of the important families of
parametric of choice models, except the multinomial logit (MNL) model. In
addition, most of the approximation schemes proposed in the literature are
tailored to a specific parametric structure. We deviate from this and propose a
general algorithm to find the optimal assortment assuming access to only a
subroutine that gives revenue predictions; this means that the algorithm can be
applied with any choice model. We prove that when the underlying choice model
is the MNL model, our algorithm can find the optimal assortment efficiently.
