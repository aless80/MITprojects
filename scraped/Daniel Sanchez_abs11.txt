It has recently been proposed that electronic band structures in crystals
give rise to a previously overlooked type of Weyl fermion, which violates
Lorentz invariance and, consequently, is forbidden in particle physics. It was
further predicted that Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ may realize such a Type II Weyl
fermion. One crucial challenge is that the Weyl points in Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$
are predicted to lie above the Fermi level. Here, by studying a simple model
for a Type II Weyl cone, we clarify the importance of accessing the unoccupied
band structure to demonstrate that Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ is a Weyl semimetal.
Then, we use pump-probe angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (pump-probe
ARPES) to directly observe the unoccupied band structure of
Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$. For the first time, we directly access states $> 0.2$ eV
above the Fermi level. By comparing our results with $\textit{ab initio}$
calculations, we conclude that we directly observe the surface state containing
the topological Fermi arc. Our work opens the way to studying the unoccupied
band structure as well as the time-domain relaxation dynamics of
Mo$_x$W$_{1-x}$Te$_2$ and related transition metal dichalcogenides.
