We examine the issue of separation and code design for networks that operate
over finite fields. We demonstrate that source-channel (or source-network)
separation holds for several canonical network examples like the noisy multiple
access channel and the erasure degraded broadcast channel, when the whole
network operates over a common finite field. This robustness of separation is
predicated on the fact that noise and inputs are independent, and we examine
the failure of separation when noise is dependent on inputs in multiple access
channels.
Our approach is based on the sufficiency of linear codes. Using a simple and
unifying framework, we not only re-establish with economy the optimality of
linear codes for single-transmitter, single-receiver channels and for
Slepian-Wolf source coding, but also establish the optimality of linear codes
for multiple access and for erasure degraded broadcast channels. The linearity
allows us to obtain simple optimal code constructions and to study capacity
regions of the noisy multiple access and the degraded broadcast channel. The
linearity of both source and network coding blurs the delineation between
source and network codes. While our results point to the fact that separation
of source coding and channel coding is optimal in some canonical networks, we
show that decomposing networks into canonical subnetworks may not be effective.
Thus, we argue that it may be the lack of decomposability of a network into
canonical network modules, rather than the lack of separation between source
and channel coding, that presents major challenges for coding over networks.
