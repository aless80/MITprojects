Quantum illumination (QI) provides entanglement-based target detection---in
an entanglement-breaking environment---whose performance is significantly
better than that of optimum classical-illumination target detection. QI's
performance advantage was established in a Bayesian setting with the target
presumed equally likely to be absent or present and error probability employed
as the performance metric. Radar theory, however, eschews that Bayesian
approach, preferring the Neyman-Pearson performance criterion to avoid the
difficulties of accurately assigning prior probabilities to target absence and
presence and appropriate costs to false-alarm and miss errors. We have recently
reported an architecture---based on sum-frequency generation (SFG) and
feedforward (FF) processing---for minimum error-probability QI target detection
with arbitrary prior probabilities for target absence and presence. In this
paper, we use our results for FF-SFG reception to determine the receiver
operating characteristic---detection probability versus false-alarm
probability---for optimum QI target detection under the Neyman-Pearson
criterion.
