We study multivariate normal models that are described by linear constraints
on the inverse of the covariance matrix. Maximum likelihood estimation for such
models leads to the problem of maximizing the determinant function over a
spectrahedron, and to the problem of characterizing the image of the positive
definite cone under an arbitrary linear projection. These problems at the
interface of statistics and optimization are here examined from the perspective
of convex algebraic geometry.
