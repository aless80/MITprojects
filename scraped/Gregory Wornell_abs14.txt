Lattice coding and decoding have been shown to achieve the capacity of the
additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel. This was accomplished using a
minimum mean-square error scaling and randomization to transform the AWGN
channel into a modulo-lattice additive noise channel of the same capacity. It
has been further shown that when operating at rates below capacity but above
the critical rate of the channel, there exists a rate-dependent scaling such
that the associated modulo-lattice channel attains the error exponent of the
AWGN channel. A geometric explanation for this result is developed. In
particular, it is shown how the geometry of typical error events for the
modulo-lattice channel coincides with that of a spherical code for the AWGN
channel.
