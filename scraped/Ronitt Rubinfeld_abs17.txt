We study the problem of estimating the Earth Mover's Distance (EMD) between
probability distributions when given access only to samples. We give closeness
testers and additive-error estimators over domains in $[0, \Delta]^d$, with
sample complexities independent of domain size - permitting the testability
even of continuous distributions over infinite domains. Instead, our algorithms
depend on other parameters, such as the diameter of the domain space, which may
be significantly smaller. We also prove lower bounds showing the dependencies
on these parameters to be essentially optimal. Additionally, we consider
whether natural classes of distributions exist for which there are algorithms
with better dependence on the dimension, and show that for highly clusterable
data, this is indeed the case. Lastly, we consider a variant of the EMD,
defined over tree metrics instead of the usual L1 metric, and give optimal
algorithms.
