The inverse diffusion curve problem focuses on automatic creation of
diffusion curve images that resemble user provided color fields. This problem
is challenging since the 1D curves have a nonlinear and global impact on
resulting color fields via a partial differential equation (PDE). We introduce
a new approach complementary to previous methods by optimizing curve geometry.
In particular, we propose a novel iterative algorithm based on the theory of
shape derivatives. The resulting diffusion curves are clean and well-shaped,
and the final image closely approximates the input. Our method provides a
user-controlled parameter to regularize curve complexity, and generalizes to
handle input color fields represented in a variety of formats.
