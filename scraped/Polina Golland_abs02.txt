High computational costs of manifold learning prohibit its application for
large point sets. A common strategy to overcome this problem is to perform
dimensionality reduction on selected landmarks and to successively embed the
entire dataset with the Nystr\"om method. The two main challenges that arise
are: (i) the landmarks selected in non-Euclidean geometries must result in a
low reconstruction error, (ii) the graph constructed from sparsely sampled
landmarks must approximate the manifold well. We propose the sampling of
landmarks from determinantal distributions on non-Euclidean spaces. Since
current determinantal sampling algorithms have the same complexity as those for
manifold learning, we present an efficient approximation running in linear
time. Further, we recover the local geometry after the sparsification by
assigning each landmark a local covariance matrix, estimated from the original
point set. The resulting neighborhood selection based on the Bhattacharyya
distance improves the embedding of sparsely sampled manifolds. Our experiments
show a significant performance improvement compared to state-of-the-art
landmark selection techniques.
