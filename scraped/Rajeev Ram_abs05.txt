Recently, the authors have demonstrated large-scale integrated systems with
several million transistors and hundreds of photonic elements. Yielding such
large-scale integrated systems requires a design-for-manufacture rigour that is
embodied in the 10 000 to 50 000 design rules that these designs must comply
within advanced complementary metal-oxide semiconductor manufacturing. Here,
the authors present a photonic design automation tool which allows automatic
generation of layouts without design-rule violations. This tool is written in
SKILL, the native language of the mainstream electric design automation
software, Cadence. This allows seamless integration of photonic and electronic
design in a single environment. The tool leverages intuitive photonic layer
definitions, allowing the designer to focus on the physical properties rather
than on technology-dependent details. For the first time the authors present an
algorithm for removal of design-rule violations from photonic layouts based on
Manhattan discretisation, Boolean and sizing operations. This algorithm is not
limited to the implementation in SKILL, and can in principle be implemented in
any scripting language. Connectivity is achieved with software-defined
waveguide ports and low-level procedures that enable auto-routing of waveguide
connections.
