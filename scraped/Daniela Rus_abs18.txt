In this paper we present a method for automatically planning optimal paths
for a group of robots that satisfy a common high level mission specification.
Each robot's motion in the environment is modeled as a weighted transition
system. The mission is given as a Linear Temporal Logic formula. In addition,
an optimizing proposition must repeatedly be satisfied. The goal is to minimize
the maximum time between satisfying instances of the optimizing proposition.
Our method is guaranteed to compute an optimal set of robot paths. We utilize a
timed automaton representation in order to capture the relative position of the
robots in the environment. We then obtain a bisimulation of this timed
automaton as a finite transition system that captures the joint behavior of the
robots and apply our earlier algorithm for the single robot case to optimize
the group motion. We present a simulation of a persistent monitoring task in a
road network environment.
