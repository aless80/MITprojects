Erasure codes offer an efficient way to decrease storage and communication
costs while implementing atomic memory service in asynchronous distributed
storage systems. In this paper, we provide erasure-code-based algorithms having
the additional ability to perform background repair of crashed nodes. A repair
operation of a node in the crashed state is triggered externally, and is
carried out by the concerned node via message exchanges with other active nodes
in the system. Upon completion of repair, the node re-enters active state, and
resumes participation in ongoing and future read, write, and repair operations.
To guarantee liveness and atomicity simultaneously, existing works assume
either the presence of nodes with stable storage, or presence of nodes that
never crash during the execution. We demand neither of these; instead we
consider a natural, yet practical network stability condition $N1$ that only
restricts the number of nodes in the crashed/repair state during broadcast of
any message.
We present an erasure-code based algorithm $RADON_C$ that is always live, and
guarantees atomicity as long as condition $N1$ holds. In situations when the
number of concurrent writes is limited, $RADON_C$ has significantly improved
storage and communication cost over a replication-based algorithm $RADON_R$,
which also works under $N1$. We further show how a slightly stronger network
stability condition $N2$ can be used to construct algorithms that never violate
atomicity. The guarantee of atomicity comes at the expense of having an
additional phase during the read and write operations.
