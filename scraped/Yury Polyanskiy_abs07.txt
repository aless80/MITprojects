We develop a new class of log-Sobolev inequalities (LSIs) that provide a
non-linear comparison between the entropy and the Dirichlet form. For the
hypercube, these LSIs imply a new version of the hypercontractivity for
functions of small support. As a consequence, we derive a sharp form of the
uncertainty principle for the hypercube: a function whose energy is
concentrated on a set of small size, and whose Fourier energy is concentrated
on a small Hamming ball must be zero. The tradeoff we derive is asymptotically
optimal. We observe that for the Euclidean space, an analogous (asymptotically
optimal) tradeoff follows from the sharp form of Young's inequality due to
Beckner. As an application, we show how uncertainty principle implies a new
estimate of the metric properties of linear maps
$\mathbb{F}_2^k\to\mathbb{F}_2^n$.
