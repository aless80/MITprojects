The disk around HD 141569 is one of a handful of systems whose weak infrared
emission is consistent with a debris disk, but still has a significant
reservoir of gas. Here we report spatially resolved mm observations of the
CO(3-2) and CO(1-0) emission as seen with the SMA and CARMA. We find that the
excitation temperature for CO is lower than expected from cospatial blackbody
grains, similar to previous observations of analogous systems, and derive a gas
mass that lies between that of gas-rich primordial disks and gas-poor debris
disks. The data also indicate a large inner hole in the CO gas distribution and
an outer radius that lies interior to the outer scattered light rings. This
spatial distribution, with the dust rings just outside the gaseous disk, is
consistent with the expected interactions between gas and dust in an optically
thin disk. This indicates that gas can have a significant effect on the
location of the dust within debris disks.
