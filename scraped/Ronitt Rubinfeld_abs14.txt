For input $x$, let $F(x)$ denote the set of outputs that are the "legal"
answers for a computational problem $F$. Suppose $x$ and members of $F(x)$ are
so large that there is not time to read them in their entirety. We propose a
model of {\em local computation algorithms} which for a given input $x$,
support queries by a user to values of specified locations $y_i$ in a legal
output $y \in F(x)$. When more than one legal output $y$ exists for a given
$x$, the local computation algorithm should output in a way that is consistent
with at least one such $y$. Local computation algorithms are intended to
distill the common features of several concepts that have appeared in various
algorithmic subfields, including local distributed computation, local
algorithms, locally decodable codes, and local reconstruction.
We develop a technique, based on known constructions of small sample spaces
of $k$-wise independent random variables and Beck's analysis in his algorithmic
approach to the Lov{\'{a}}sz Local Lemma, which under certain conditions can be
applied to construct local computation algorithms that run in {\em
polylogarithmic} time and space. We apply this technique to maximal independent
set computations, scheduling radio network broadcasts, hypergraph coloring and
satisfying $k$-SAT formulas.
