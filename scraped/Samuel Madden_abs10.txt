Relational databases have limited support for data collaboration, where teams
collaboratively curate and analyze large datasets. Inspired by software version
control systems like git, we propose (a) a dataset version control system,
giving users the ability to create, branch, merge, difference and search large,
divergent collections of datasets, and (b) a platform, DataHub, that gives
users the ability to perform collaborative data analysis building on this
version control system. We outline the challenges in providing dataset version
control at scale.
