Strong resilience properties of dynamical flow networks are analyzed for
distributed routing policies. The latter are characterized by the property that
the way the inflow at a non-destination node gets split among its outgoing
links is allowed to depend only on local information about the current particle
densities on the outgoing links. The strong resilience of the network is
defined as the infimum sum of link-wise flow capacity reductions under which
the network cannot maintain the asymptotic total inflow to the destination node
to be equal to the inflow at the origin. A class of distributed routing
policies that are locally responsive to local information is shown to yield the
maximum possible strong resilience under such local information constraints for
an acyclic dynamical flow network with a single origin-destination pair. The
maximal strong resilience achievable is shown to be equal to the minimum node
residual capacity of the network. The latter depends on the limit flow of the
unperturbed network and is defined as the minimum, among all the
non-destination nodes, of the sum, over all the links outgoing from the node,
of the differences between the maximum flow capacity and the limit flow of the
unperturbed network. We propose a simple convex optimization problem to solve
for equilibrium limit flows of the unperturbed network that minimize average
delay subject to strong resilience guarantees, and discuss the use of tolls to
induce such an equilibrium limit flow in transportation networks. Finally, we
present illustrative simulations to discuss the connection between cascaded
failures and the resilience properties of the network.
