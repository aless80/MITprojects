We extend a recently introduced method for computing Casimir forces between
arbitrarily--shaped metallic objects [M. T. H. Reid et al., Phys. Rev.
Lett._103_ 040401 (2009)] to allow treatment of objects with arbitrary material
properties, including imperfect conductors, dielectrics, and magnetic
materials. Our original method considered electric currents on the surfaces of
the interacting objects; the extended method considers both electric and
magnetic surface current distributions, and obtains the Casimir energy of a
configuration of objects in terms of the interactions of these effective
surface currents. Using this new technique, we present the first predictions of
Casimir interactions in several experimentally relevant geometries that would
be difficult to treat with any existing method. In particular, we investigate
Casimir interactions between dielectric nanodisks embedded in a dielectric
fluid; we identify the threshold surface--surface separation at which
finite--size effects become relevant, and we map the rotational energy
landscape of bound nanoparticle diclusters.
