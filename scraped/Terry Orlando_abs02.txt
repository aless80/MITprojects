We present measurements of coherence and successive decay dynamics of higher
energy levels of a superconducting transmon qubit. By applying consecutive
$\pi$-pulses for each sequential transition frequency, we excite the qubit from
the ground state up to its fourth excited level and characterize the decay and
coherence of each state. We find the decay to proceed mainly sequentially, with
relaxation times in excess of 20 $\mu$s for all transitions. We also provide a
direct measurement of the charge dispersion of these levels by analyzing
beating patterns in Ramsey fringes. The results demonstrate the feasibility of
using higher levels in transmon qubits for encoding quantum information.
