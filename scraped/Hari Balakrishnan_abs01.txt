Many algorithms for congestion control, scheduling, network measurement,
active queue management, security, and load balancing require custom processing
of packets as they traverse the data plane of a network switch. To run at line
rate, these data-plane algorithms must be in hardware. With today's switch
hardware, algorithms cannot be changed, nor new algorithms installed, after a
switch has been built.
This paper shows how to program data-plane algorithms in a high-level
language and compile those programs into low-level microcode that can run on
emerging programmable line-rate switching chipsets. The key challenge is that
these algorithms create and modify algorithmic state. The key idea to achieve
line-rate programmability for stateful algorithms is the notion of a packet
transaction : a sequential code block that is atomic and isolated from other
such code blocks. We have developed this idea in Domino, a C-like imperative
language to express data-plane algorithms. We show with many examples that
Domino provides a convenient and natural way to express sophisticated
data-plane algorithms, and show that these algorithms can be run at line rate
with modest estimated die-area overhead.
