We present and study the Static-Routing-Resiliency problem, motivated by
routing on the Internet: Given a graph $G$, a unique destination vertex $d$,
and an integer constant $c>0$, does there exist a static and destination-based
routing scheme such that the correct delivery of packets from any source $s$ to
the destination $d$ is guaranteed so long as (1) no more than $c$ edges fail
and (2) there exists a physical path from $s$ to $d$? We embark upon a
systematic exploration of this fundamental question in a variety of models
(deterministic routing, randomized routing, with packet-duplication, with
packet-header-rewriting) and present both positive and negative results that
relate the edge-connectivity of a graph, i.e., the minimum number of edges
whose deletion partitions $G$, to its resiliency.
