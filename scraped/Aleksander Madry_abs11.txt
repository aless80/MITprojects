We combine the work of Garg and Konemann, and Fleischer with ideas from
dynamic graph algorithms to obtain faster (1-eps)-approximation schemes for
various versions of the multicommodity flow problem. In particular, if eps is
moderately small and the size of every number used in the input instance is
polynomially bounded, the running times of our algorithms match - up to
poly-logarithmic factors and some provably optimal terms - the Omega(mn)
flow-decomposition barrier for single-commodity flow.
