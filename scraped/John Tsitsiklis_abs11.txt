We consider the problem of packet scheduling in single-hop queueing networks,
and analyze the impact of heavy-tailed traffic on the performance of Max-Weight
scheduling. As a performance metric we use the delay stability of traffic
flows: a traffic flow is delay stable if its expected steady-state delay is
finite, and delay unstable otherwise. First, we show that a heavy-tailed
traffic flow is delay unstable under any scheduling policy. Then, we focus on
the celebrated Max-Weight scheduling policy, and show that a light-tailed flow
that conflicts with a heavy-tailed flow is also delay unstable. This is true
irrespective of the rate or the tail distribution of the light-tailed flow, or
other scheduling constraints in the network. Surprisingly, we show that a
light-tailed flow can be delay unstable, even when it does not conflict with
heavy-tailed traffic. Furthermore, delay stability in this case may depend on
the rate of the light-tailed flow. Finally, we turn our attention to the class
of Max-Weight-a scheduling policies; we show that if the a-parameters are
chosen suitably, then the sum of the a-moments of the steady-state queue
lengths is finite. We provide an explicit upper bound for the latter quantity,
from which we derive results related to the delay stability of traffic flows,
and the scaling of moments of steady-state queue lengths with traffic
intensity.
