Neutron resonance spectrometry (NRS) has been used to measure the temperature
inside Mo samples during shock loading. The temperatures obtained were
significantly higher than predicted assuming ideal hydrodynamic loading. The
effect of plastic flow and non-ideal projectile behavior were assessed. Plastic
flow was calculated self-consistently with the shock jump conditions: this is
necessary for a rigorous estimate of the locus of shock states accessible.
Plastic flow was estimated to contribute a temperature rise of 53K compared
with hydrodynamic flow. Simulations were performed of the operation of the
explosively-driven projectile system used to induce the shock in the Mo sample.
The simulations predicted that the projectile was significantly curved on
impact, and still accelerating. The resulting spatial variations in load,
including radial components of velocity, were predicted to increase the
apparent temperature that would be deduced from the width of the neutron
resonance by 160K. These corrections are sufficient to reconcile the apparent
temperatures deduced using NRS with the accepted properties of Mo, in
particular its equation of state.
