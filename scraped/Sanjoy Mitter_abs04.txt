A randomized covering-packing duality between source and channel coding will
be discussed by considering the source coding problem of coding a source with a
certain distortion level and by considering a channel which communicates the
source within a certain distortion level. An operational view of source-channel
separation for communication with a fidelity criterion will be discussed in
brief.
