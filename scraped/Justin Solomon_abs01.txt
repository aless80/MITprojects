Optimal transportation provides a means of lifting distances between points
on a geometric domain to distances between signals over the domain, expressed
as probability distributions. On a graph, transportation problems can be used
to express challenging tasks involving matching supply to demand with minimal
shipment expense; in discrete language, these become minimum-cost network flow
problems. Regularization typically is needed to ensure uniqueness for the
linear ground distance case and to improve optimization convergence;
state-of-the-art techniques employ entropic regularization on the
transportation matrix. In this paper, we explore a quadratic alternative to
entropic regularization for transport over a graph. We theoretically analyze
the behavior of quadratically-regularized graph transport, characterizing how
regularization affects the structure of flows in the regime of small but
nonzero regularization. We further exploit elegant second-order structure in
the dual of this problem to derive an easily-implemented Newton-type
optimization algorithm.
