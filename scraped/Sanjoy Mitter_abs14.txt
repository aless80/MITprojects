In part I, we reviewed how Shannon's classical notion of capacity is not
sufficient to characterize a noisy communication channel if the channel is
intended to be used as part of a feedback loop to stabilize an unstable scalar
linear system. While classical capacity is not enough, a sense of capacity
(parametrized by reliability) called "anytime capacity" is both necessary and
sufficient for channel evaluation in this context. The rate required is the log
of the open-loop system gain and the required reliability comes from the
desired sense of stability. Sufficiency is maintained even in cases with noisy
observations and without any explicit feedback between the observer and the
controller. This established the asymptotic equivalence between scalar
stabilization problems and delay-universal communication problems with
feedback.
Here in part II, the vector-state generalizations are established and it is
the magnitudes of the unstable eigenvalues that play an essential role. To deal
with such systems, the concept of the anytime rate-region is introduced. This
is the region of rates that the channel can support while still meeting
potentially different anytime reliability targets for parallel message streams.
All the scalar results generalize on an eigenvalue by eigenvalue basis. When
there is no explicit feedback of the noisy channel outputs, the intrinsic delay
of the unstable system tells us what the feedback delay needs to be while
evaluating the anytime-rate-region for the channel. An example involving a
binary erasure channel is used to illustrate how differentiated service is
required in any separation-based control architecture.
