Deep neural networks (DNNs) are currently widely used for many artificial
intelligence (AI) applications including computer vision, speech recognition,
and robotics. While DNNs deliver state-of-the-art accuracy on many AI tasks, it
comes at the cost of high computational complexity. Accordingly, techniques
that enable efficient processing of deep neural network to improve
energy-efficiency and throughput without sacrificing performance accuracy or
increasing hardware cost are critical to enabling the wide deployment of DNNs
in AI systems.
This article aims to provide a comprehensive tutorial and survey about the
recent advances towards the goal of enabling efficient processing of DNNs.
Specifically, it will provide an overview of DNNs, discuss various platforms
and architectures that support DNNs, and highlight key trends in recent
efficient processing techniques that reduce the computation cost of DNNs either
solely via hardware design changes or via joint hardware design and network
algorithm changes. It will also summarize various development resources that
can enable researchers and practitioners to quickly get started on DNN design,
and highlight important benchmarking metrics and design considerations that
should be used for evaluating the rapidly growing number of DNN hardware
designs, optionally including algorithmic co-design, being proposed in academia
and industry.
The reader will take away the following concepts from this article:
understand the key design considerations for DNNs; be able to evaluate
different DNN hardware implementations with benchmarks and comparison metrics;
understand trade-offs between various architectures and platforms; be able to
evaluate the utility of various DNN design techniques for efficient processing;
and understand of recent implementation trends and opportunities.
