Electrical charging of metal surfaces due to photoelectric generation of
carriers is of concern in trapped ion quantum computation systems, due to the
high sensitivity of the ions' motional quantum states to deformation of the
trapping potential. The charging induced by typical laser frequencies involved
in doppler cooling and quantum control is studied here, with microfabricated
surface electrode traps made of aluminum, copper, and gold, operated at 6 K
with a single Sr$^+$ ion trapped 100 $\mu$m above the trap surface. The lasers
used are at 370, 405, 460, and 674 nm, and the typical photon flux at the trap
is 10$^{14}$ photons/cm$^2$/sec. Charging is detected by monitoring the ion's
micromotion signal, which is related to the number of charges created on the
trap. A wavelength and material dependence of the charging behavior is
observed: lasers at lower wavelengths cause more charging, and aluminum
exhibits more charging than copper or gold. We describe the charging dynamic
based on a rate equation approach.
