Compressive Sensing (CS) stipulates that a sparse signal can be recovered
from a small number of linear measurements, and that this recovery can be
performed efficiently in polynomial time. The framework of model-based
compressive sensing (model-CS) leverages additional structure in the signal and
prescribes new recovery schemes that can reduce the number of measurements even
further. However, model-CS requires an algorithm that solves the
model-projection problem: given a query signal, produce the signal in the model
that is also closest to the query signal. Often, this optimization can be
computationally very expensive. Moreover, an approximation algorithm is not
sufficient for this optimization task. As a result, the model-projection
problem poses a fundamental obstacle for extending model-CS to many interesting
models.
In this paper, we introduce a new framework that we call
approximation-tolerant model-based compressive sensing. This framework includes
a range of algorithms for sparse recovery that require only approximate
solutions for the model-projection problem. In essence, our work removes the
aforementioned obstacle to model-based compressive sensing, thereby extending
the applicability of model-CS to a much wider class of models. We instantiate
this new framework for the Constrained Earth Mover Distance (CEMD) model, which
is particularly useful for signal ensembles where the positions of the nonzero
coefficients do not change significantly as a function of spatial (or temporal)
location. We develop novel approximation algorithms for both the maximization
and the minimization versions of the model-projection problem via graph
optimization techniques. Leveraging these algorithms into our framework results
in a nearly sample-optimal sparse recovery scheme for the CEMD model.
