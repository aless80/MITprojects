We propose an optical scheme, employing optical parametric down-converters
interlaced with nonlinear sign gates (NSGs), that completely converts an
$n$-photon Fock-state pump to $n$ signal-idler photon pairs when the
down-converters' crystal lengths are chosen appropriately. The proof of this
assertion relies on amplitude amplification, analogous to that employed in
Grover search, applied to the full quantum dynamics of single-mode parametric
down-conversion. When we require that all Grover iterations use the same
crystal, and account for potential experimental limitations on crystal-length
precision, our optimized conversion efficiencies reach unity for $1\le n \le
5$, after which they decrease monotonically for $n$ values up to 50, which is
the upper limit of our numerical dynamics evaluations. Nevertheless, our
conversion efficiencies remain higher than those for a conventional (no NSGs)
down-converter.
