Maintaining leadership in HPC requires the ability to support simulations at
large scales and fidelity. In this study, we detail one of the most significant
productivity challenges in achieving this goal, namely the increasing
proclivity to bugs, especially in the face of growing hardware and software
heterogeneity and sheer system scale. We identify key areas where timely new
research must be proactively begun to address these challenges, and create new
correctness tools that must ideally play a significant role even while ramping
up toward exacale. We close with the proposal for a two-day workshop in which
the problems identified in this report can be more broadly discussed, and
specific plans to launch these new research thrusts identified.
