A model for THz generation by optical rectification using tilted-pulse-fronts
is developed. It simultaneously accounts for (i) the spatio-temporal
distortions of the optical pump pulse, (ii) the nonlinear coupled interaction
of THz and optical radiation in two spatial dimensions (2-D), (iii) self-phase
modulation and (iv) stimulated Raman scattering. The model is validated by
quantitative agreement with experiments and analytic calculations. We show that
the optical pump beam is significantly broadened in the transverse-momentum
(kx) domain as a consequence of the spectral broadening caused by THz
generation. In the presence of this large frequency and transverse-momentum (or
angular) spread, group velocity dispersion causes a spatio-temporal break-up of
the optical pump pulse which inhibits further THz generation. The implications
of these effects on energy scaling and optimization of optical-to-THz
conversion efficiency are discussed. This suggests the use of optical pump
pulses with elliptical beam profiles for large optical pump energies. It is
seen that optimization of the setup is highly dependent on optical pump
conditions. Trade-offs of optimizing the optical-to-THz conversion efficiency
on the spatial and spectral properties of THz radiation is discussed to guide
the development of such sources.
