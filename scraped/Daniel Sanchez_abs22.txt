Weyl semimetals may open a new era in condensed matter physics, materials
science and nanotech after graphene and topological insulators. We report the
first atomic scale view of the surface states of a Weyl semimetal (NbP) using
scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy. We observe coherent quantum
interference patterns that arise from the scattering of quasiparticles near
point defects on the surface. The measurements reveal the surface electronic
structure both below and above the chemical potential in both real and
reciprocal spaces. Moreover, the interference maps uncover the scattering
processes of NbP's exotic surface states. Through comparison between
experimental data and theoretical calculations, we further discover that the
scattering channels are largely restricted by the orbital and/or spin texture
of the surface band. The visualization of the scattering processes can help
design novel transport effects and electronics on the topological surface of a
Weyl semimetal.
