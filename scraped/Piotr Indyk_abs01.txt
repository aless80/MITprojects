In the Sparse Linear Regression (SLR) problem, given a $d \times n$ matrix
$M$ and a $d$-dimensional vector $q$, we want to compute a $k$-sparse vector
$\tau$ such that the error $||M \tau-q||$ is minimized. In this paper, we
present algorithms and conditional lower bounds for several variants of this
problem. In particular, we consider (i) the Affine SLR where we add the
constraint that $\sum_i \tau_i=1$ and (ii) the Convex SLR where we further add
the constraint that $\tau \geq 0$. Furthermore, we consider (i) the batched
(offline) setting, where the matrix $M$ and the vector $q$ are given as inputs
in advance, and (ii) the query(online) setting, where an algorithm preprocesses
the matrix $M$ to quickly answer such queries. All of the aforementioned
variants have been well-studied and have many applications in statistics,
machine learning and sparse recovery.
We consider the approximate variants of these problems in the "low sparsity
regime" where the value of the sparsity bound $k$ is low. In particular, we
show that the online variant of all three problems can be solved with query
time $\tilde O(n^{k-1})$. This provides non-trivial improvements over the naive
algorithm that exhaustively searches all ${ n \choose k}$ subsets $B$. We also
show that solving the offline variant of all three problems, would require an
exponential dependence of the form $\tilde \Omega(n^{k/2}/e^{k})$, under a
natural complexity-theoretic conjecture. Improving this lower bound for the
case of $k=4$ would imply a nontrivial lower bound for the famous Hopcroft's
problem. Moreover, solving the offline variant of affine SLR in $o(n^{k-1})$
would imply an upper bound of $o(n^d)$ for the problem of testing whether a
given set of $n$ points in a $d$-dimensional space is degenerate. However, this
is conjectured to require $\Omega(n^d)$ time.
