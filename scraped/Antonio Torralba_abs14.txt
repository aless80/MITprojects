Scene parsing, or recognizing and segmenting objects and stuff in an image,
is one of the key problems in computer vision. Despite the community's efforts
in data collection, there are still few image datasets covering a wide range of
scenes and object categories with dense and detailed annotations for scene
parsing. In this paper, we introduce and analyze the ADE20K dataset, spanning
diverse annotations of scenes, objects, parts of objects, and in some cases
even parts of parts. A generic network design called Cascade Segmentation
Module is then proposed to enable the segmentation networks to parse a scene
into stuff, objects, and object parts in a cascade. We evaluate the proposed
module integrated within two existing semantic segmentation networks, yielding
significant improvements for scene parsing. We further show that the scene
parsing networks trained on ADE20K can be applied to a wide variety of scenes
and objects.
