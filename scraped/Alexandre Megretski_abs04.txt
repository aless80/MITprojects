We construct structured H-Infinity optimal model matching problems with
rational coefficients, in which the optimal solution is not rational, in the
sense that the cost does not achieve its maximal lower bound on the set of
rational matching models, but the same maximal lower bound can be reached by
using a continuous non-rational matching model.
