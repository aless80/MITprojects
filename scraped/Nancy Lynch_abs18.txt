A method of analyzing time bounds for randomized distributed algorithms is
presented, in the context of a new and general framework for describing and
reasoning about randomized algorithms. The method consists of proving auxiliary
statements of the form U (t)->(p) U', which means that whenever the algorithm
begins in a state in set U, with probability p, it will reach a state in set U'
within time t. The power of the method is illustrated by its use in proving a
constant upper bound on the expected time for some process to reach its
critical region, in Lehmann and Rabin's Dining Philosophers algorithm.
