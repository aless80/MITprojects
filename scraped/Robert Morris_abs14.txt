We study sum-free sets in sparse random subsets of even order abelian groups.
In particular, we determine the sharp threshold for the following property: the
largest such set is contained in some maximum-size sum-free subset of the
group. This theorem extends recent work of Balogh, Morris and Samotij, who
resolved the case G = Z_{2n}, and who obtained a weaker threshold (up to a
constant factor) in general.
