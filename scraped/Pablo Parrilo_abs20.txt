Distributed control problems under some specific information constraints can
be formulated as (possibly infinite dimensional) convex optimization problems.
The underlying motivation of this work is to develop an understanding of the
optimal decision making architecture for such problems. In this paper, we
particularly focus on the N-player triangular LQG problems and show that the
optimal output feedback controllers have attractive state space realizations.
The optimal controller can be synthesized using a set of stabilizing solutions
to 2N linearly coupled algebraic Riccati equations, which turn out to be easily
solvable under reasonable assumptions.
