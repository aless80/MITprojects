BigDAWG is a polystore system designed to work on complex problems that
naturally span across different processing or storage engines. BigDAWG provides
an architecture that supports diverse database systems working with different
data models, support for the competing notions of location transparency and
semantic completeness via islands of information and a middleware that provides
a uniform multi-island interface. In this article, we describe the current
architecture of BigDAWG, its application on the MIMIC II medical dataset, and
our plans for the mechanics of cross-system queries. During the presentation,
we will also deliver a brief demonstration of the current version of BigDAWG.
