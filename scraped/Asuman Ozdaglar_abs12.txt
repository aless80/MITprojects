This paper proposes a new measure of node centrality in social networks, the
Harmonic Influence Centrality, which emerges naturally in the study of social
influence over networks. Using an intuitive analogy between social and
electrical networks, we introduce a distributed message passing algorithm to
compute the Harmonic Influence Centrality of each node. Although its design is
based on theoretical results which assume the network to have no cycle, the
algorithm can also be successfully applied on general graphs.
