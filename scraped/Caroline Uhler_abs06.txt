A graphical model encodes conditional independence relations via the Markov
properties. For an undirected graph these conditional independence relations
can be represented by a simple polytope known as the graph associahedron, which
can be constructed as a Minkowski sum of standard simplices. There is an
analogous polytope for conditional independence relations coming from a regular
Gaussian model, and it can be defined using multiinformation or relative
entropy. For directed acyclic graphical models and also for mixed graphical
models containing undirected, directed and bidirected edges, we give a
construction of this polytope, up to equivalence of normal fans, as a Minkowski
sum of matroid polytopes. Finally, we apply this geometric insight to construct
a new ordering-based search algorithm for causal inference via directed acyclic
graphical models.
