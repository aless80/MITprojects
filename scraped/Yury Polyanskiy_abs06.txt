We give new bounds on the reliability function of a typewriter channel with 5
inputs and crossover probability $1/2$. The lower bound is more of theoretical
than practical importance; it improves very marginally the expurgated bound,
providing a counterexample to a conjecture on its tightness by Shannon,
Gallager and Berlekamp which does not need the construction of
algebraic-geometric codes previously used by Katsman, Tsfasman and
Vl\u{a}du\c{t}. The upper bound is derived by using an adaptation of the linear
programming bound and it is essentially useful as a low-rate anchor for the
straight line bound.
