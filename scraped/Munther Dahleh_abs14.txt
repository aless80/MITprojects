In this paper, we examine in an abstract framework, how a tradeoff between
efficiency and robustness arises in different dynamic oligopolistic market
architectures. We consider a market in which there is a monopolistic resource
provider and agents that enter and exit the market following a random process.
Self-interested and fully rational agents dynamically update their resource
consumption decisions over a finite time horizon, under the constraint that the
total resource consumption requirements are met before each individual's
deadline. We then compare the statistics of the stationary aggregate demand
processes induced by the non-cooperative and cooperative load scheduling
schemes. We show that although the non-cooperative load scheduling scheme leads
to an efficiency loss - widely known as the "price of anarchy" - the stationary
distribution of the corresponding aggregate demand process has a smaller tail.
This tail, which corresponds to rare and undesirable demand spikes, is
important in many applications of interest. On the other hand, when the agents
can cooperate with each other in optimizing their total cost, a higher market
efficiency is achieved at the cost of a higher probability of demand spikes. We
thus posit that the origins of endogenous risk in such systems may lie in the
market architecture, which is an inherent characteristic of the system.
