Mean Field Variational Bayes (MFVB) is a popular posterior approximation
method due to its fast runtime on large-scale data sets. However, it is well
known that a major failing of MFVB is its (sometimes severe) underestimates of
the uncertainty of model variables and lack of information about model variable
covariance. We develop a fast, general methodology for exponential families
that augments MFVB to deliver accurate uncertainty estimates for model
variables -- both for individual variables and coherently across variables.
MFVB for exponential families defines a fixed-point equation in the means of
the approximating posterior, and our approach yields a covariance estimate by
perturbing this fixed point. Inspired by linear response theory, we call our
method linear response variational Bayes (LRVB). We demonstrate the accuracy of
our method on simulated data sets.
