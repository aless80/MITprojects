We present a method to generate a robot control strategy that maximizes the
probability to accomplish a task. The task is given as a Linear Temporal Logic
(LTL) formula over a set of properties that can be satisfied at the regions of
a partitioned environment. We assume that the probabilities with which the
properties are satisfied at the regions are known, and the robot can determine
the truth value of a proposition only at the current region. Motivated by
several results on partitioned-based abstractions, we assume that the motion is
performed on a graph. To account for noisy sensors and actuators, we assume
that a control action enables several transitions with known probabilities. We
show that this problem can be reduced to the problem of generating a control
policy for a Markov Decision Process (MDP) such that the probability of
satisfying an LTL formula over its states is maximized. We provide a complete
solution for the latter problem that builds on existing results from
probabilistic model checking. We include an illustrative case study.
