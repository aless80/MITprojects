In this paper we present the MOSFIRE Deep Evolution Field (MOSDEF) survey.
The MOSDEF survey aims to obtain moderate-resolution (R=3000-3650) rest-frame
optical spectra (~3700-7000 Angstrom) for ~1500 galaxies at 1.37<z<3.80 in
three well-studied CANDELS fields: AEGIS, COSMOS, and GOODS-N. Targets are
selected in three redshift intervals: 1.37<z<1.70, 2.09<z<2.61, and
2.95<z<3.80, down to fixed H_AB (F160W) magnitudes of 24.0, 24.5 and 25.0,
respectively, using the photometric and spectroscopic catalogs from the 3D-HST
survey. We target both strong nebular emission lines (e.g., [OII], Hbeta,
[OIII], 5008, Halpha, [NII], and [SII]) and stellar continuum and absorption
features (e.g., Balmer lines, Ca-II H and K, Mgb, 4000 Angstrom break). Here we
present an overview of our survey, the observational strategy, the data
reduction and analysis, and the sample characteristics based on spectra
obtained during the first 24 nights. To date, we have completed 21 masks,
obtaining spectra for 591 galaxies. For ~80% of the targets we derive a robust
redshift from either emission or absorption lines. In addition, we confirm 55
additional galaxies, which were serendipitously detected. The MOSDEF galaxy
sample includes unobscured star-forming, dusty star-forming, and quiescent
galaxies and spans a wide range in stellar mass (~10^9-10^11.5 Msol) and star
formation rate (~10^0-10^3 Msol/yr). The spectroscopically confirmed sample is
roughly representative of an H-band limited galaxy sample at these redshifts.
With its large sample size, broad diversity in galaxy properties, and wealth of
available ancillary data, MOSDEF will transform our understanding of the
stellar, gaseous, metal, dust, and black hole content of galaxies during the
time when the universe was most active.
