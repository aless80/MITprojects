Topological superconductors host new states of quantum matter which show a
pairing gap in the bulk and gapless surface states providing a platform to
realize Majorana fermions. Recently, alkaline-earth metal Sr intercalated
Bi2Se3 has been reported to show superconductivity with a Tc ~ 3 K and a large
shielding fraction. Here we report systematic normal state electronic structure
studies of Sr0.06Bi2Se3 (Tc ~ 2.5 K) by performing photoemission spectroscopy.
Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we observe a quantum
well confined two-dimensional (2D) state coexisting with a topological surface
state in Sr0.06Bi2Se3. Furthermore, our time-resolved ARPES reveals the
relaxation dynamics showing different decay mechanism between the excited
topological surface states and the two-dimensional states. Our experimental
observation is understood by considering the intra-band scattering for
topological surface states and an additional electron phonon scattering for the
2D states, which is responsible for the superconductivity. Our first-principles
calculations agree with the more effective scattering and a shorter lifetime of
the 2D states. Our results will be helpful in understanding low temperature
superconducting states of these topological materials.
