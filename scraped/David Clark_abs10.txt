Shock and release temperatures in Mo were calculated, taking account of
heating from plastic flow predicted using the Steinberg-Guinan model. Plastic
flow was calculated self-consistently with the shock jump conditions: this is
necessary for a rigorous estimate of the locus of shock states accessible. The
temperatures obtained were significantly higher than predicted assuming ideal
hydrodynamic loading. The temperatures were compared with surface emission
spectrometry measurements for Mo shocked to around 60GPa and then released into
vacuum or into a LiF window. Shock loading was induced by the impact of a
planar projectile, accelerated by high explosive or in a gas gun. Surface
velocimetry showed an elastic wave at the start of release from the shocked
state; the amplitude of the elastic wave matched the prediction to around 10%,
indicating that the predicted flow stress in the shocked state was reasonable.
The measured temperatures were consistent with the simulations, indicating that
the fraction of plastic work converted to heat was in the range 70-100% for
these loading conditions.
