The lack of energy dissipation and abrupt electrical phase transition of
superconductors favorite them for nanoscale technologies, including radiation
detectors, and quantum technologies. Moreover, understanding the nanoscale
behavior of superconductivity is significant for revealing the onset of
collective-electron behavior in nature. Nevertheless, the limited number of
accessible superconductors restricts availability of the superconducting
properties, encumbering the realization of their potential. Superconducting
nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) sense single-IR photons faster and
more efficient with respect to competing technologies. However, these
advantageous properties are material-dependent causing an undesirable
speed-efficiency payoff. Usually, SNSPDs based on granular materials are
faster, while those based on amorphous materials are more efficient. Here we
optimized ultrathin films of granular NbN on SiO2 and of amorphous W5Si3. We
showed that hybrid superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs)
made of 2-nm-thick W5Si3 films over 2-nm-thick NbN films exhibit advantageous
coexistence of timing (< 5-ns reset time and 52-ps timing jitter) and
efficiency (> 96% quantum efficiency) performance. We propose that the
governing mechanism of this hybridization is the presence of a dual
superconducting behavior: native superconductivity of each of the films and
superconductivity that is induced from the neighboring film via the proximity
effect. In addition to improvement in SNSPDs performance, our results suggest
that such hybridization can expand the range of available superconducting
properties, impacting nano-superconducting technologies. Lastly, this
hybridization may be used to tune the amorphous character of superconducting
films and to illuminate the elusive onset of collective-electron behavior near
the superconducting-to-insulating transition.
