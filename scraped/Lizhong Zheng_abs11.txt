Abstract: The bit-wise unequal error protection problem, for the case when the number
of groups of bits $\ell$ is fixed, is considered for variable length block
codes with feedback. An encoding scheme based on fixed length block codes with
erasures is used to establish inner bounds to the achievable performance for
finite expected decoding time. A new technique for bounding the performance of
variable length block codes is used to establish outer bounds to the
performance for a given expected decoding time. The inner and the outer bounds
match one another asymptotically and characterize the achievable region of
rate-exponent vectors, completely. The single message message-wise unequal
error protection problem for variable length block codes with feedback is also
solved as a necessary step on the way.
