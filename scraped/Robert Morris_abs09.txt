The Kepler mission discovered 2842 exoplanet candidates with 2 years of data.
We provide updates to the Kepler planet candidate sample based upon 3 years
(Q1-Q12) of data. Through a series of tests to exclude false-positives,
primarily caused by eclipsing binary stars and instrumental systematics, 855
additional planetary candidates have been discovered, bringing the total number
known to 3697. We provide revised transit parameters and accompanying posterior
distributions based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm for the cumulative
catalogue of Kepler Objects of Interest. There are now 130 candidates in the
cumulative catalogue that receive less than twice the flux the Earth receives
and more than 1100 have a radius less than 1.5 Rearth. There are now a dozen
candidates meeting both criteria, roughly doubling the number of candidate
Earth analogs. A majority of planetary candidates have a high probability of
being bonafide planets, however, there are populations of likely
false-positives. We discuss and suggest additional cuts that can be easily
applied to the catalogue to produce a set of planetary candidates with good
fidelity. The full catalogue is publicly available at the NASA Exoplanet
Archive.
