The Riccati inequality and equality are studied for infinite dimensional
linear discrete time stationary systems with respect to the scattering supply
rate. The results obtained are an addition to and based on our earlier work on
the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov inequality in [6]. The main theorems are closely
related to the results of Yu. M. Arlinski\u{\i} in [3]. The main difference is
that we do not assume the original system to be a passive scattering system,
and we allow the solutions of the Riccati inequality and equality to satisfy
weaker conditions.
