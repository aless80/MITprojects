In an electric power system, demand fluctuations may result in significant
ancillary cost to suppliers. Furthermore, in the near future, deep penetration
of volatile renewable electricity generation is expected to exacerbate the
variability of demand on conventional thermal generating units. We address this
issue by explicitly modeling the ancillary cost associated with demand
variability. We argue that a time-varying price equal to the suppliers'
instantaneous marginal cost may not achieve social optimality, and that
consumer demand fluctuations should be properly priced. We propose a dynamic
pricing mechanism that explicitly encourages consumers to adapt their
consumption so as to offset the variability of demand on conventional units.
Through a dynamic game-theoretic formulation, we show that (under suitable
convexity assumptions) the proposed pricing mechanism achieves social
optimality asymptotically, as the number of consumers increases to infinity.
Numerical results demonstrate that compared with marginal cost pricing, the
proposed mechanism creates a stronger incentive for consumers to shift their
peak load, and therefore has the potential to reduce the need for long-term
investment in peaking plants.
