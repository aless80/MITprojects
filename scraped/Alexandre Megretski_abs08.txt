The paper proposes a control-theoretic framework for verification of
numerical software systems, and puts forward software verification as an
important application of control and systems theory. The idea is to transfer
Lyapunov functions and the associated computational techniques from control
systems analysis and convex optimization to verification of various software
safety and performance specifications. These include but are not limited to
absence of overflow, absence of division-by-zero, termination in finite time,
presence of dead-code, and certain user-specified assertions. Central to this
framework are Lyapunov invariants. These are properly constructed functions of
the program variables, and satisfy certain properties-resembling those of
Lyapunov functions-along the execution trace. The search for the invariants can
be formulated as a convex optimization problem. If the associated optimization
problem is feasible, the result is a certificate for the specification.
