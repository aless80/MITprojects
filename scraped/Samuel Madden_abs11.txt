Crowd-sourcing has become a popular means of acquiring labeled data for a
wide variety of tasks where humans are more accurate than computers, e.g.,
labeling images, matching objects, or analyzing sentiment. However, relying
solely on the crowd is often impractical even for data sets with thousands of
items, due to time and cost constraints of acquiring human input (which cost
pennies and minutes per label). In this paper, we propose algorithms for
integrating machine learning into crowd-sourced databases, with the goal of
allowing crowd-sourcing applications to scale, i.e., to handle larger datasets
at lower costs. The key observation is that, in many of the above tasks, humans
and machine learning algorithms can be complementary, as humans are often more
accurate but slow and expensive, while algorithms are usually less accurate,
but faster and cheaper.
Based on this observation, we present two new active learning algorithms to
combine humans and algorithms together in a crowd-sourced database. Our
algorithms are based on the theory of non-parametric bootstrap, which makes our
results applicable to a broad class of machine learning models. Our results, on
three real-life datasets collected with Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and on 15
well-known UCI data sets, show that our methods on average ask humans to label
one to two orders of magnitude fewer items to achieve the same accuracy as a
baseline that labels random images, and two to eight times fewer questions than
previous active learning schemes.
