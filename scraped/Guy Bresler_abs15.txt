Abstract: Markov random fields are used to model high dimensional distributions in a
number of applied areas. Much recent interest has been devoted to the
reconstruction of the dependency structure from independent samples from the
Markov random fields. We analyze a simple algorithm for reconstructing the
underlying graph defining a Markov random field on $n$ nodes and maximum degree
$d$ given observations. We show that under mild non-degeneracy conditions it
reconstructs the generating graph with high probability using $\Theta(d
\epsilon^{-2}\delta^{-4} \log n)$ samples where $\epsilon,\delta$ depend on the
local interactions. For most local interaction $\eps,\delta$ are of order
$\exp(-O(d))$.
Our results are optimal as a function of $n$ up to a multiplicative constant
depending on $d$ and the strength of the local interactions. Our results seem
to be the first results for general models that guarantee that {\em the}
generating model is reconstructed. Furthermore, we provide explicit $O(n^{d+2}
\epsilon^{-2}\delta^{-4} \log n)$ running time bound. In cases where the
measure on the graph has correlation decay, the running time is $O(n^2 \log n)$
for all fixed $d$. We also discuss the effect of observing noisy samples and
show that as long as the noise level is low, our algorithm is effective. On the
other hand, we construct an example where large noise implies
non-identifiability even for generic noise and interactions. Finally, we
briefly show that in some simple cases, models with hidden nodes can also be
recovered.
