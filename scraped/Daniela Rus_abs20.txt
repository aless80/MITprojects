In this paper, we develop a method to automatically generate a control policy
for a dynamical system modeled as a Markov Decision Process (MDP). The control
specification is given as a Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) formula over a set of
propositions defined on the states of the MDP. We synthesize a control policy
such that the MDP satisfies the given specification almost surely, if such a
policy exists. In addition, we designate an "optimizing proposition" to be
repeatedly satisfied, and we formulate a novel optimization criterion in terms
of minimizing the expected cost in between satisfactions of this proposition.
We propose a sufficient condition for a policy to be optimal, and develop a
dynamic programming algorithm that synthesizes a policy that is optimal under
some conditions, and sub-optimal otherwise. This problem is motivated by
robotic applications requiring persistent tasks, such as environmental
monitoring or data gathering, to be performed.
