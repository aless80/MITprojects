We propose a novel approach to improving software security called
Cryptographic Path Hardening, which is aimed at hiding security vulnerabilities
in software from attackers through the use of provably secure and obfuscated
cryptographic devices to harden paths in programs.
By "harden" we mean that certain error-checking if-conditionals in a given
program P are replaced by equivalent" we mean that adversaries cannot use
semi-automatic program analysis techniques to reason about the hardened program
paths and thus cannot discover as-yet-unknown errors along those paths, except
perhaps through black-box dictionary attacks or random testing (which we can
never prevent).
Other than these unpreventable attack methods, we can make program analysis
aimed at error-finding "provably hard" for a resource-bounded attacker, in the
same sense that cryptographic schemes are hard to break. Unlike
security-through-obscurity, in Cryptographic Path Hardening we use
provably-secure crypto devices to hide errors and our mathematical arguments of
security are the same as the standard ones used in cryptography.
One application of Cryptographic Path Hardening is that software patches or
filters often reveal enough information to an attacker that they can be used to
construct error-revealing inputs to exploit an unpatched version of the
program. By "hardening" the patch we make it difficult for the attacker to
analyze the patched program to construct error-revealing inputs, and thus
prevent him from potentially constructing exploits.
