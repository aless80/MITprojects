Graphene and topological insulators (TI) possess two-dimensional Dirac
fermions with distinct physical properties. Integrating these two Dirac
materials in a single device creates interesting opportunities for exploring
new physics of interacting massless Dirac fermions. Here we report on a
practical route to experimental fabrication of graphene-Sb2Te3 heterostructure.
The graphene-TI heterostructures are prepared by using a dry transfer of
chemical-vapor-deposition grown graphene film. ARPES measurements confirm the
coexistence of topological surface states of Sb2Te3 and Dirac {\pi} bands of
graphene, and identify the twist angle in the graphene-TI heterostructure. The
results suggest a potential tunable electronic platform in which two different
Dirac low-energy states dominate the transport behavior.
