Patient notes contain a wealth of information of potentially great interest
to medical investigators. However, to protect patients' privacy, Protected
Health Information (PHI) must be removed from the patient notes before they can
be legally released, a process known as patient note de-identification. The
main objective for a de-identification system is to have the highest possible
recall. Recently, the first neural-network-based de-identification system has
been proposed, yielding state-of-the-art results. Unlike other systems, it does
not rely on human-engineered features, which allows it to be quickly deployed,
but does not leverage knowledge from human experts or from electronic health
records (EHRs). In this work, we explore a method to incorporate
human-engineered features as well as features derived from EHRs to a
neural-network-based de-identification system. Our results show that the
addition of features, especially the EHR-derived features, further improves the
state-of-the-art in patient note de-identification, including for some of the
most sensitive PHI types such as patient names. Since in a real-life setting
patient notes typically come with EHRs, we recommend developers of
de-identification systems to leverage the information EHRs contain.
