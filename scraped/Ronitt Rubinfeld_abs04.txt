In the model of \emph{local computation algorithms} (LCAs), we aim to compute
the queried part of the output by examining only a small (sublinear) portion of
the input. Many recently developed LCAs on graph problems achieve time and
space complexities with very low dependence on $n$, the number of vertices.
Nonetheless, these complexities are generally at least exponential in $d$, the
upper bound on the degree of the input graph. Instead, we consider the case
where parameter $d$ can be moderately dependent on $n$, and aim for
complexities with subexponential dependence on $d$, while maintaining
polylogarithmic dependence on $n$. We present: a randomized LCA for computing
maximal independent sets whose time and space complexities are quasi-polynomial
in $d$ and polylogarithmic in $n$; for constant $\epsilon > 0$, a randomized
LCA that provides a $(1-\epsilon)$-approximation to maximum matching whose time
and space complexities are polynomial in $d$ and polylogarithmic in $n$.
