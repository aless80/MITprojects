Abstract: Recently, Etkin, Tse, and Wang found the capacity region of the two-user
Gaussian interference channel to within one bit/s/Hz. A natural goal is to
apply this approach to the Gaussian interference channel with an arbitrary
number of users. We make progress towards this goal by finding the capacity
region of the many-to-one and one-to-many Gaussian interference channels to
within a constant number of bits. The result makes use of a deterministic model
to provide insight into the Gaussian channel. The deterministic model makes
explicit the dimension of signal scale. A central theme emerges: the use of
lattice codes for alignment of interfering signals on the signal scale.
