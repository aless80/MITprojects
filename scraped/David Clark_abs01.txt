Temporarily Captured Orbiters (TCOs) are Near-Earth Objects (NEOs) which make
a few orbits of Earth before returning to heliocentric orbits. Only one TCO has
been observed to date, 2006 RH120, captured by Earth for one year before
escaping. Detailed modeling predicts capture should occur from the NEO
population predominantly through the Sun-Earth L1 and L2 points, with 1% of
TCOs impacting Earth and approximately 0.1% of meteoroids being TCOs. Although
thousands of meteoroid orbits have been measured, none until now have
conclusively exhibited TCO behaviour, largely due to difficulties in measuring
initial meteoroid speed with sufficient precision. We report on a precise
meteor observation of January 13, 2014 by a new generation of all-sky fireball
digital camera systems operated in the Czech Republic as part of the European
Fireball Network, providing the lowest natural object entry speed observed in
decades long monitoring by networks world-wide. Modeling atmospheric
deceleration and fragmentation yields an initial mass of ~5 kg and diameter of
15 cm, with a maximum Earth-relative velocity just over 11.0 km/s. Spectral
observations prove its natural origin. Back-integration across observational
uncertainties yields a 92 - 98% probability of TCO behaviour, with close lunar
dynamical interaction. The capture duration varies across observational
uncertainties from 48 days to 5+ years. We also report on two low-speed impacts
recorded by US Government sensors, and we examine Prairie Network event PN39078
from 1965 having an extremely low entry speed of 10.9 km/s. In these cases
uncertainties in measurement and origin make TCO designation uncertain.
