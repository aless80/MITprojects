Traditional spectral clustering methods cannot naturally learn the number of
communities in a network and often fail to detect smaller community structure
in dense networks because they are based upon external community connectivity
properties such as graph cuts. We propose an algorithm for detecting community
structure in networks called the leader-follower algorithm which is based upon
the natural internal structure expected of communities in social networks. The
algorithm uses the notion of network centrality in a novel manner to
differentiate leaders (nodes which connect different communities) from loyal
followers (nodes which only have neighbors within a single community). Using
this approach, it is able to naturally learn the communities from the network
structure and does not require the number of communities as an input, in
contrast to other common methods such as spectral clustering. We prove that it
will detect all of the communities exactly for any network possessing
communities with the natural internal structure expected in social networks.
More importantly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the leader-follower
algorithm in the context of various real networks ranging from social networks
such as Facebook to biological networks such as an fMRI based human brain
network. We find that the leader-follower algorithm finds the relevant
community structure in these networks without knowing the number of communities
beforehand. Also, because the leader-follower algorithm detects communities
using their internal structure, we find that it can resolve a finer community
structure in dense networks than common spectral clustering methods based on
external community structure.
