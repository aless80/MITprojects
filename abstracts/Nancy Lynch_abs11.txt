We introduce the study of the ant colony house-hunting problem from a
distributed computing perspective. When an ant colony's nest becomes unsuitable
due to size constraints or damage, the colony must relocate to a new nest. The
task of identifying and evaluating the quality of potential new nests is
distributed among all ants. The ants must additionally reach consensus on a
final nest choice and the full colony must be transported to this single new
nest. Our goal is to use tools and techniques from distributed computing theory
in order to gain insight into the house-hunting process.
We develop a formal model for the house-hunting problem inspired by the
behavior of the Temnothorax genus of ants. We then show a \Omega(log n) lower
bound on the time for all n ants to agree on one of k candidate nests. We also
present two algorithms that solve the house-hunting problem in our model. The
first algorithm solves the problem in optimal O(log n) time but exhibits some
features not characteristic of natural ant behavior. The second algorithm runs
in O(k log n) time and uses an extremely simple and natural rule for each ant
to decide on the new nest.
