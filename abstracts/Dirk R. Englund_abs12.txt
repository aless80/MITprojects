In the effort to make 2D materials-based devices smaller, faster, and more
efficient, it is important to control charge carrier at lengths approaching the
nanometer scale. Traditional gating techniques based on capacitive coupling
through a gate dielectric cannot generate strong and uniform electric fields at
this scale due to divergence of the fields in dielectrics. This field
divergence limits the gating strength, boundary sharpness, and pitch size of
periodic structures, and restricts possible geometries of local gates (due to
wire packaging), precluding certain device concepts, such as plasmonics and
transformation optics based on metamaterials. Here we present a new gating
concept based on a dielectric-free self-aligned electrolyte technique that
allows spatially modulating charges with nanometer resolution. We employ a
combination of a solid-polymer electrolyte gate and an ion-impenetrable
e-beam-defined resist mask to locally create excess charges on top of the gated
surface. Electrostatic simulations indicate high carrier density variations of
$\Delta n =10^{14}\text{cm}^{-2}$ across a length of 10 nm at the mask
boundaries on the surface of a 2D conductor, resulting in a sharp depletion
region and a strong in-plane electric field of $6\times10^8 \text{Vm}^{-1}$
across the so-created junction. We apply this technique to the 2D material
graphene to demonstrate the creation of tunable p-n junctions for
optoelectronic applications. We also demonstrate the spatial versatility and
self-aligned properties of this technique by introducing a novel graphene
thermopile photodetector.
