Hierarchical uncertainty quantification can reduce the computational cost of
stochastic circuit simulation by employing spectral methods at different
levels. This paper presents an efficient framework to simulate hierarchically
some challenging stochastic circuits/systems that include high-dimensional
subsystems. Due to the high parameter dimensionality, it is challenging to both
extract surrogate models at the low level of the design hierarchy and to handle
them in the high-level simulation. In this paper, we develop an efficient
ANOVA-based stochastic circuit/MEMS simulator to extract efficiently the
surrogate models at the low level. In order to avoid the curse of
dimensionality, we employ tensor-train decomposition at the high level to
construct the basis functions and Gauss quadrature points. As a demonstration,
we verify our algorithm on a stochastic oscillator with four MEMS capacitors
and 184 random parameters. This challenging example is simulated efficiently by
our simulator at the cost of only 10 minutes in MATLAB on a regular personal
computer.
