Scaling-up from prototype systems to dense arrays of ions on chip, or vast
networks of ions connected by photonic channels, will require developing
entirely new technologies that combine miniaturized ion trapping systems with
devices to capture, transmit and detect light, while refining how ions are
confined and controlled. Building a cohesive ion system from such diverse parts
involves many challenges, including navigating materials incompatibilities and
undesired coupling between elements. Here, we review our recent efforts to
create scalable ion systems incorporating unconventional materials such as
graphene and indium tin oxide, integrating devices like optical fibers and
mirrors, and exploring alternative ion loading and trapping techniques.
