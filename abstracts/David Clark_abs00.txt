Malware creators have been getting their way for too long now. String-based
similarity measures can leverage ground truth in a scalable way and can operate
at a level of abstraction that is difficult to combat from the code level. We
introduce ITect, a scalable approach to malware similarity detection based on
information theory. ITect targets file entropy patterns in different ways to
achieve 100% precision with 90% accuracy but it could target 100% recall
instead. It outperforms VirusTotal for precision and accuracy on combined
Kaggle and VirusShare malware.
