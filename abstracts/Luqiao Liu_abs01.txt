Despite the potential advantages of information storage in
antiferromagnetically coupled materials, it remains unclear whether one can
control the magnetic moment orientation efficiently because of the cancelled
magnetic moment. Here, we report spin-orbit torque induced magnetization
switching of ferrimagnetic Co1-xTbx films with perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy. Current induced switching is demonstrated in all of the studied
film compositions, including those near the magnetization compensation point.
The spin-orbit torque induced effective field is further quantified in the
domain wall motion regime. A divergent behavior that scales with the inverse of
magnetic moment is confirmed close to the compensation point, which is
consistent with angular momentum conservation. Moreover, we also quantify the
Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction energy in the Ta/Co1-xTbx system and we find
that the energy density increases as a function of the Tb concentration. The
demonstrated spin-orbit torque switching, in combination with the fast magnetic
dynamics and minimal net magnetization of ferrimagnetic alloys, promises
spintronic devices that are faster and with higher density than traditional
ferromagnetic systems.
