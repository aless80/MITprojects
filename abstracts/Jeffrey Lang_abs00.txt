Spatially-dense pressure measurements are needed on curved surfaces in marine
environments to provide marine vehicles with the detailed, real-time
measurements of the near-field flow necessary to improve performance through
flow control. To address this challenge, a waterproof and conformal pressure
sensor array comprising carbon black-doped-silicone closed-cell foam (CBPDMS
foam) was developed for use in marine applications. The response of the CBPDMS
foam sensor arrays was characterized using periodic hydrodynamic pressure
stimuli from vertical plunging, from which a piecewise polynomial calibration
was developed to describe the sensor response. Inspired by the distributed
pressure and velocity sensing capabilities of the fish lateral line, the CBPDMS
foam sensor arrays have significant advantages over existing commercial sensors
for distributed flow reconstruction and control. Experimental results have
shown the sensor arrays to have sensitivity on the order of 5 Pascal, dynamic
range of 50-500 Pascal; are contained in a waterproof and completely flexible
package, and have material cost less than $10 per sensor.
