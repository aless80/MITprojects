This article is a translation of Bruno de Finetti's paper "Funzione
Caratteristica di un fenomeno aleatorio" which appeared in Atti del Congresso
Internazionale dei Matematici, Bologna 3-10 Settembre 1928, Tomo VI, pp.
179-190, originally published by Nicola Zanichelli Editore S.p.A. The
translation was made as close as possible to the original in form and style,
except for apparent mistakes found in the original document, which were
corrected and are mentioned as footnotes. Most of these were resolved by
comparing against a longer version of this work by de Finetti, published
shortly after this one under the same titlea. The interested reader is highly
encouraged to consult this other version for a more detailed treatment of the
topics covered here. Footnotes regarding the translation are labeled with
letters to distinguish them from de Finetti's original footnotes.
