We analyze the problem of maximum likelihood estimation for Gaussian
distributions that are multivariate totally positive of order two (MTP2). By
exploiting connections to phylogenetics and single-linkage clustering, we give
a simple proof that the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) for such
distributions exists based on at least 2 observations, irrespective of the
underlying dimension. Slawski and Hein, who first proved this result, also
provided empirical evidence showing that the MTP2 constraint serves as an
implicit regularizer and leads to sparsity in the estimated inverse covariance
matrix, determining what we name the ML graph. We show that the maximum weight
spanning forest (MWSF) of the empirical correlation matrix is a spanning forest
of the ML graph. In addition, we show that we can find an upper bound for the
ML graph by adding edges to the MSWF corresponding to correlations in excess of
those explained by the forest. This also gives new theoretical results in the
study of inverse M-matrices. We provide globally convergent coordinate descent
algorithms for calculating the MLE under the MTP2 constraint which are
structurally similar to iterative proportional scaling. We conclude the paper
with a discussion of signed MTP2 distributions.
