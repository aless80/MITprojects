Motivation: Modeling biological signaling networks using ordinary
differential equations (ODEs) has proven to be a powerful technique for
generating insight into cellular dynamics, but it typically requires estimating
rate parameters based on experimentally observed concentrations. New
measurement methods can measure concentrations for all molecular species in a
pathway, which creates a new opportunity to decompose the optimization of rate
parameters. Results: In contrast with conventional methods that minimize the
disagreement between simulated and observed concentrations, the BPPE method
fits a spline curve through the observed concentration points, and then matches
the derivatives of the spline-curve to the production and consumption of each
species. Whereas traditional methods follow the ODEs exactly and then attempt
to match the data, BPPE follows the data exactly and then attempts to match the
ODEs. The new objective function is an extreme decomposition of the problem
because each factor in the function is enforcing the equality of one ODE at one
timeslice. A "loopy belief propagation" algorithm solves this factorized
approximation of the parameter estimation problem providing systematic coverage
of the search space and unique asymptotic behavior; the run time is polynomial
in the number of molecules and timepoints, but exponential in the degree of the
biochemical network. The implementation is a global-local hybrid optimization,
and we compare with the performance of local, global, and hybrid methods. BPPE
is demonstrated for a novel model of Akt activation dynamics including
redox-mediated inactivation of PTEN. Availability: Software and supplementary
