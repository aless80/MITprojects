We study the multi-message broadcast problem using abstract MAC layer models
of wireless networks. These models capture the key guarantees of existing MAC
layers while abstracting away low-level details such as signal propagation and
contention. We begin by studying upper and lower bounds for this problem in a
{\em standard abstract MAC layer model}---identifying an interesting dependence
between the structure of unreliable links and achievable time complexity. In
more detail, given a restriction that devices connected directly by an
unreliable link are not too far from each other in the reliable link topology,
we can (almost) match the efficiency of the reliable case. For the related
restriction, however, that two devices connected by an unreliable link are not
too far from each other in geographic distance, we prove a new lower bound that
shows that this efficiency is impossible. We then investigate how much extra
power must be added to the model to enable a new order of magnitude of
efficiency. In more detail, we consider an {\em enhanced abstract MAC layer
model} and present a new multi-message broadcast algorithm that (under certain
natural assumptions) solves the problem in this model faster than any known
solutions in an abstract MAC layer setting.
