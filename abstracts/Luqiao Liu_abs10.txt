We demonstrate that the spin Hall effect in a thin film with strong
spin-orbit scattering can excite magnetic precession in an adjacent
ferromagnetic film. The flow of alternating current through a Pt/NiFe bilayer
generates an oscillating transverse spin current in the Pt, and the resultant
transfer of spin angular momentum to the NiFe induces ferromagnetic resonance
(FMR) dynamics. The Oersted field from the current also generates an FMR signal
but with a different symmetry. The ratio of these two signals allows a
quantitative determination of the spin current and the spin Hall angle.
