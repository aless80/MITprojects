A central question in optimization is to maximize (or minimize) a linear
function over a given polytope P. To solve such a problem in practice one needs
a concise description of the polytope P. In this paper we are interested in
representations of P using the positive semidefinite cone: a positive
semidefinite lift (psd lift) of a polytope P is a representation of P as the
projection of an affine slice of the positive semidefinite cone
$\mathbf{S}^d_+$. Such a representation allows linear optimization problems
over P to be written as semidefinite programs of size d. Such representations
can be beneficial in practice when d is much smaller than the number of facets
of the polytope P. In this paper we are concerned with so-called equivariant
psd lifts (also known as symmetric psd lifts) which respect the symmetries of
the polytope P. We present a representation-theoretic framework to study
equivariant psd lifts of a certain class of symmetric polytopes known as
orbitopes. Our main result is a structure theorem where we show that any
equivariant psd lift of size d of an orbitope is of sum-of-squares type where
the functions in the sum-of-squares decomposition come from an invariant
subspace of dimension smaller than d^3. We use this framework to study two
well-known families of polytopes, namely the parity polytope and the cut
polytope, and we prove exponential lower bounds for equivariant psd lifts of
these polytopes.
