The paper deals with the task of optimal design of Analog to Digital
Converters (ADCs). A general ADC is modeled as a causal discrete-time dynamical
system with outputs taking values in a finite set, and its performance is
defined as the worst-case average intensity of the filtered input matching
error. The design task can be viewed as that of optimal quantized decision
making in a system, with the objective being to optimize the performance
measure. An algorithm is proposed for designing optimal ADCs and certifying
their optimality. The algorithm is based on exploiting a special structure in
the underlying dynamic program, which makes it possible to find the optimal
value function, and hence the optimal quantization law exactly and
analytically. Moreover, the designed ADC is shown to have the classical
Delta-Sigma Modulator (DSM) structure with optimal quantization step spacing.
