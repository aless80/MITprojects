The local broadcast problem assumes that processes in a wireless network are
provided messages, one by one, that must be delivered to their neighbors. In
this paper, we prove tight bounds for this problem in two well-studied wireless
network models: the classical model, in which links are reliable and collisions
consistent, and the more recent dual graph model, which introduces unreliable
edges. Our results prove that the Decay strategy, commonly used for local
broadcast in the classical setting, is optimal. They also establish a
separation between the two models, proving that the dual graph setting is
strictly harder than the classical setting, with respect to this primitive.
