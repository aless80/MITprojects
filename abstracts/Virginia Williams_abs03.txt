The girth of a graph, i.e. the length of its shortest cycle, is a fundamental
graph parameter. Unfortunately all known algorithms for computing, even
approximately, the girth and girth-related structures in directed weighted
$m$-edge and $n$-node graphs require $\Omega(\min\{n^{\omega}, mn\})$ time (for
$2\leq\omega<2.373$). In this paper, we drastically improve these runtimes as
follows:
* Multiplicative Approximations in Nearly Linear Time: We give an algorithm
that in $\widetilde{O}(m)$ time computes an $\widetilde{O}(1)$-multiplicative
approximation of the girth as well as an $\widetilde{O}(1)$-multiplicative
roundtrip spanner with $\widetilde{O}(n)$ edges with high probability (w.h.p).
* Nearly Tight Additive Approximations: For unweighted graphs and any $\alpha
\in (0,1)$ we give an algorithm that in $\widetilde{O}(mn^{1 - \alpha})$ time
computes an $O(n^\alpha)$-additive approximation of the girth as well as an
$O(n^\alpha)$-additive roundtrip spanner with $\widetilde{O}(n^{2-\alpha})$
edges w.h.p. We show that the runtime of our algorithm cannot be significantly
improved without a breakthrough in combinatorial Boolean matrix multiplication,
and that unconditionally the size of our spanner is essentially optimal.
Our main technical contribution to achieve these results is the first nearly
linear time algorithm for computing roundtrip covers, a directed graph
decomposition concept key to previous roundtrip spanner constructions.
Previously it was not known how to compute these significantly faster than
$\Omega(\min\{n^\omega, mn\})$ time. Given the traditional difficulty in
efficiently processing directed graphs, we hope our techniques may find further
applications.
