Stream processing addresses the needs of real-time applications. Transaction
processing addresses the coordination and safety of short atomic computations.
Heretofore, these two modes of operation existed in separate, stove-piped
systems. In this work, we attempt to fuse the two computational paradigms in a
single system called S-Store. In this way, S-Store can simultaneously
accommodate OLTP and streaming applications. We present a simple transaction
model for streams that integrates seamlessly with a traditional OLTP system. We
chose to build S-Store as an extension of H-Store, an open-source, in-memory,
distributed OLTP database system. By implementing S-Store in this way, we can
make use of the transaction processing facilities that H-Store already
supports, and we can concentrate on the additional implementation features that
are needed to support streaming. Similar implementations could be done using
other main-memory OLTP platforms. We show that we can actually achieve higher
throughput for streaming workloads in S-Store than an equivalent deployment in
H-Store alone. We also show how this can be achieved within H-Store with the
addition of a modest amount of new functionality. Furthermore, we compare
S-Store to two state-of-the-art streaming systems, Spark Streaming and Storm,
and show how S-Store matches and sometimes exceeds their performance while
providing stronger transactional guarantees.
