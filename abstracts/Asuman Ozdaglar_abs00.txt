We study the optimal pricing policy of a strategic monopolist selling durable
goods in a dynamic pricing game with multiple rounds. Customers are
forward-looking and experience a (positive) network externality, i.e., each
customer's utility depends not only on her valuation of the item and the
offered price, but also the weighted sum of the number of other customers who
have purchased the item. The monopolist announces and commits to a price
sequence and strategic buyers decide on when (if ever) to buy the good in a
perfect Bayesian equilibrium. We fully characterize the optimal pricing policy
and show that it is linearly increasing in time, where the slope of the price
path is described by a single network measure: sum of the entries of the
inverse of network externality matrix, termed network effects. Our result shows
that increasing the number of rounds and network effects increases both revenue
and social welfare. We also study the effect of price discrimination and
establish that in the earlier rounds the price offered to more central buyers
is lower. This is to encourage them to buy earlier which in turn increases the
externality of other buyers and incentivize them to buy in subsequent rounds.
