Network alignment refers to the problem of finding a bijective mapping across
vertices of two graphs to maximize the number of overlapping edges and/or to
minimize the number of mismatched interactions across networks. This problem is
often cast as an expensive quadratic assignment problem (QAP). Although
spectral methods have received significant attention in different network
science problems such as network clustering, the use of spectral techniques in
the network alignment problem has been limited partially owing to the lack of
principled connections between spectral methods and relaxations of the network
alignment optimization. In this paper, we propose a network alignment framework
that uses an orthogonal relaxation of the underlying QAP in a maximum weight
bipartite matching optimization. Our method takes into account the ellipsoidal
level sets of the quadratic objective function by exploiting eigenvalues and
eigenvectors of (transformations of) adjacency graphs. Our framework not only
can be employed to provide a theoretical justification for existing heuristic
spectral network alignment methods, but it also leads to a new scalable network
alignment algorithm which outperforms existing ones over various synthetic and
real networks. Moreover, we generalize the objective function of the network
alignment problem to consider both matched and mismatched interactions in a
standard QAP formulation. This can be critical in applications where networks
have low similarity and therefore we expect more mismatches than matches. We
assess the effectiveness of our proposed method theoretically for certain
classes of networks, through simulations over various synthetic network models,
and in two real-data applications; in comparative analysis of gene regulatory
networks across human, fly and worm, and in user de-anonymization over twitter
follower subgraphs.
