This paper addresses the problem of finding minimum forcing sets in origami.
The origami material folds flat along straight lines called creases that can be
labeled as mountains or valleys. A forcing set is a subset of creases that
force all the other creases to fold according to their labels. The result is a
flat folding of the origami material. In this paper we develop a linear time
algorithm that finds minimum forcing sets in one dimensional origami.
