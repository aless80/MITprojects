This paper investigates the maximal achievable rate for a given blocklength
and error probability over quasi-static multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO)
fading channels, with and without channel state information (CSI) at the
transmitter and/or the receiver. The principal finding is that outage capacity,
despite being an asymptotic quantity, is a sharp proxy for the
finite-blocklength fundamental limits of slow-fading channels. Specifically,
the channel dispersion is shown to be zero regardless of whether the fading
realizations are available at both transmitter and receiver, at only one of
them, or at neither of them. These results follow from analytically tractable
converse and achievability bounds. Numerical evaluation of these bounds
verifies that zero dispersion may indeed imply fast convergence to the outage
capacity as the blocklength increases. In the example of a particular $1 \times
2$ single-input multiple-output (SIMO) Rician fading channel, the blocklength
required to achieve $90\%$ of capacity is about an order of magnitude smaller
compared to the blocklength required for an AWGN channel with the same
capacity. For this specific scenario, the coding/decoding schemes adopted in
the LTE-Advanced standard are benchmarked against the finite-blocklength
achievability and converse bounds.
