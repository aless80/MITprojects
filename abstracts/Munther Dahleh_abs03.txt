We investigate the ability of a homogeneous collection of deferrable energy
loads to behave as a battery; that is, to absorb and release energy in a
controllable fashion up to fixed and predetermined limits on volume, charge
rate and discharge rate. We derive explicit bounds on the battery capacity that
can be offered, and show that there is a fundamental trade-off between the
abilities of collective load to absorb and release energy at high aggregate
rates. Finally, we introduce a new class of dynamic priority-driven feedback
policies that balance these abilities, and characterize the batteries that they
can emulate.
