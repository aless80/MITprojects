We investigate double transitivity of Galois groups in the classical Schubert
calculus on Grassmannians. We show that all Schubert problems on Grassmannians
of 2- and 3-planes have doubly transitive Galois groups, as do all Schubert
problems involving only special Schubert conditions. We use these results to
give a new proof that Schubert problems on Grassmannians of 2-planes have
Galois groups that contain the alternating group. We also investigate the
Galois group of every Schubert problem on Gr(4,8), finding that each Galois
group either contains the alternating group or is an imprimitive permutation
group and therefore fails to be doubly transitive. These imprimitive examples
show that our results are the best possible general results on double
transitivity of Schubert problems.
