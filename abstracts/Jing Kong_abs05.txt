Ultrafast electron thermalization - the process leading to Auger
recombination, carrier multiplication via impact ionization and hot carrier
luminescence - occurs when optically excited electrons in a material undergo
rapid electron-electron scattering to redistribute excess energy and reach
electronic thermal equilibrium. Due to extremely short time and length scales,
the measurement and manipulation of electron thermalization in nanoscale
devices remains challenging even with the most advanced ultrafast laser
techniques. Here, we overcome this challenge by leveraging the atomic thinness
of two-dimensional van der Waals (vdW) materials in order to introduce a highly
tunable electron transfer pathway that directly competes with electron
thermalization. We realize this scheme in a graphene-boron nitride-graphene
(G-BN-G) vdW heterostructure, through which optically excited carriers are
transported from one graphene layer to the other. By applying an interlayer
bias voltage or varying the excitation photon energy, interlayer carrier
transport can be controlled to occur faster or slower than the intralayer
scattering events, thus effectively tuning the electron thermalization pathways
in graphene. Our findings, which demonstrate a novel means to probe and
directly modulate electron energy transport in nanoscale materials, represent
an important step toward designing and implementing novel optoelectronic and
energy-harvesting devices with tailored microscopic properties.
