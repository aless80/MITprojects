We analyze the convergence rate of the random reshuffling (RR) method, which
is a randomized first-order incremental algorithm for minimizing a finite sum
of convex component functions. RR proceeds in cycles, picking a uniformly
random order (permutation) and processing the component functions one at a time
according to this order, i.e., at each cycle, each component function is
sampled without replacement from the collection. Though RR has been numerically
observed to outperform its with-replacement counterpart stochastic gradient
descent (SGD), characterization of its convergence rate has been a long
standing open question. In this paper, we answer this question by showing that
when the component functions are quadratics or smooth and the sum function is
strongly convex, RR with iterate averaging and a diminishing stepsize
$\alpha_k=\Theta(1/k^s)$ for $s\in (1/2,1)$ converges at rate
$\Theta(1/k^{2s})$ with probability one in the suboptimality of the objective
value, thus improving upon the $\Omega(1/k)$ rate of SGD. Our analysis draws on
the theory of Polyak-Ruppert averaging and relies on decoupling the dependent
cycle gradient error into an independent term over cycles and another term
dominated by $\alpha_k^2$. This allows us to apply law of large numbers to an
appropriately weighted version of the cycle gradient errors, where the weights
depend on the stepsize. We also provide high probability convergence rate
estimates that shows decay rate of different terms and allows us to propose a
modification of RR with convergence rate ${\cal O}(\frac{1}{k^2})$.
