One of the astounding consequences of quantum mechanics is that it allows the
detection of a target using an incident probe, with only a low probability of
interaction of the probe and the target. This 'quantum weirdness' could be
applied in the field of electron microscopy to generate images of
beam-sensitive specimens with substantially reduced damage to the specimen. A
reduction of beam-induced damage to specimens is especially of great importance
if it can enable imaging of biological specimens with atomic resolution.
Following a recent suggestion that interaction-free measurements are possible
with electrons, we now analyze the difficulties of actually building an atomic
resolution interaction-free electron microscope, or "quantum electron
microscope". A quantum electron microscope would require a number of unique
components not found in conventional transmission electron microscopes. These
components include a coherent electron-beam splitter or two-state-coupler, and
a resonator structure to allow each electron to interrogate the specimen
multiple times, thus supporting high success probabilities for interaction-free
detection of the specimen. Different system designs are presented here, which
are based on four different choices of two-state-couplers: a thin crystal, a
grating mirror, a standing light wave and an electro-dynamical pseudopotential.
Challenges for the detailed electron optical design are identified as future
directions for development. While it is concluded that it should be possible to
build an atomic resolution quantum electron microscope, we have also identified
a number of hurdles to the development of such a microscope and further
theoretical investigations that will be required to enable a complete
interpretation of the images produced by such a microscope.
