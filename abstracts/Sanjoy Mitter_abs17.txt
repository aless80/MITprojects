We introduce a general framework for treating channels with memory and
feedback. First, we generalize Massey's concept of directed information and use
it to characterize the feedback capacity of general channels. Second, we
present coding results for Markov channels. This requires determining
appropriate sufficient statistics at the encoder and decoder. Third, a dynamic
programming framework for computing the capacity of Markov channels is
presented. Fourth, it is shown that the average cost optimality equation (ACOE)
can be viewed as an implicit single-letter characterization of the capacity.
Fifth, scenarios with simple sufficient statistics are described.
