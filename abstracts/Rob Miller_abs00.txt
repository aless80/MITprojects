We present PEC, an Event Calculus (EC) style action language for reasoning
about probabilistic causal and narrative information. It has an action language
style syntax similar to that of the EC variant Modular-E. Its semantics is
given in terms of possible worlds which constitute possible evolutions of the
domain, and builds on that of EFEC, an epistemic extension of EC. We also
describe an ASP implementation of PEC and show the sense in which this is sound
and complete.
