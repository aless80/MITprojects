It is well known that unconditionally secure bit commitment is impossible
even in the quantum world. In this paper a weak variant of quantum bit
commitment, introduced independently by Aharonov et al. [STOC, 2000] and Hardy
and Kent [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 (2004)] is investigated. In this variant, the
parties require some nonzero probability of detecting a cheating, i.e. if Bob,
who commits a bit b to Alice, changes his mind during the revealing phase then
Alice detects the cheating with a positive probability (we call this property
binding); and if Alice gains information about the committed bit before the
revealing phase then Bob discovers this with positive probability (sealing). In
our paper we give quantum bit commitment scheme that is simultaneously binding
and sealing and we show that if a cheating gives epsilon advantage to a
malicious Alice then Bob can detect the cheating with a probability
Omega(epsilon^2). If Bob cheats then Alice's probability of detecting the
cheating is greater than some fixed constant lambda>0. This improves the
probabilities of cheating detections shown by Hardy and Kent and the scheme by
Aharonov et al. who presented a protocol that is either binding or sealing, but
not simultaneously both. To construct a cheat sensitive quantum bit commitment
scheme we use a protocol for a weak quantum one-out-of-two oblivious transfer.
