We present a centralized algorithmic framework for solving multi-robot path
planning problems in general, two-dimensional, continuous environments while
minimizing globally the task completion time. The framework obtains high levels
of effectiveness through the composition of an optimal discretization of the
continuous environment and the subsequent fast, near-optimal resolution of the
resulting discrete planning problem. This principled approach achieves orders
of magnitudes better performance with respect to both speed and the supported
robot density. For a wide variety of environments, our method is shown to
compute globally near-optimal solutions for fifty robots in seconds with robots
packed close to each other. In the extreme, the method can consistently solve
problems with hundreds of robots that occupy over 30% of the free space.
