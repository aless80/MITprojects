An information theoretic framework for unequal error protection is developed
in terms of the exponential error bounds. The fundamental difference between
the bit-wise and message-wise unequal error protection (UEP) is demonstrated,
for fixed length block codes on DMCs without feedback. Effect of feedback is
investigated via variable length block codes. It is shown that, feedback
results in a significant improvement in both bit-wise and message-wise UEP
(except the single message case for missed detection). The distinction between
false-alarm and missed-detection formalizations for message-wise UEP is also
considered. All results presented are at rates close to capacity.
