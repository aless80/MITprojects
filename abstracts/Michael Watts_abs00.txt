Light carrying orbital angular momentum (OAM) has potential to impact a wide
variety of applications ranging from optical communications to quantum
information and optical forces for the excitation and manipulation of atoms,
molecules, and micro-particles. The unique advantage of utilizing OAM in these
applications relies, to a large extent, on the use of multiple different OAM
states. Therefore, it is desirable to have a device that is able to gen- erate
light with freely adjustable OAM states in an integrated form for large- scale
integration. We propose and demonstrate a compact silicon photonic integrated
circuit to generate a free-space optical beam with OAM state con- tinuously
tuned from a single electrical input signal, realizing both integer and
non-integer OAM states. The compactness and flexibility of the device and its
compatibility with complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) pro- cessing
hold promise for integration with other silicon photonic components for
wide-ranging applications.
