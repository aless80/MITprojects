In recent years it has become popular to study dynamic problems in a
sensitivity setting: Instead of allowing for an arbitrary sequence of updates,
the sensitivity model only allows to apply batch updates of small size to the
original input data. The sensitivity model is particularly appealing since
recent strong conditional lower bounds ruled out fast algorithms for many
dynamic problems, such as shortest paths, reachability, or subgraph
connectivity.
In this paper we prove conditional lower bounds for sensitivity problems. For
example, we show that under the Boolean Matrix Multiplication (BMM) conjecture
combinatorial algorithms cannot compute the (4/3 - {\epsilon})-approximate
diameter of an undirected unweighted dense graph with truly subcubic
preprocessing time and truly subquadratic update/query time. This result is
surprising since in the static setting it is not clear whether a reduction from
BMM to diameter is possible. We further show under the BMM conjecture that many
problems, such as reachability or approximate shortest paths, cannot be solved
faster than by recomputation from scratch even after only one or two edge
insertions. We give more lower bounds under the Strong Exponential Time
Hypothesis and the All Pairs Shortest Paths Conjecture. Many of our lower
bounds also hold for static oracle data structures where no sensitivity is
required. Finally, we give the first algorithm for the (1 +
{\epsilon})-approximate radius, diameter, and eccentricity problems in directed
or undirected unweighted graphs in case of single edges failures. The algorithm
has a truly subcubic running time for graphs with a truly subquadratic number
of edges; it is tight w.r.t. the conditional lower bounds we obtain.
