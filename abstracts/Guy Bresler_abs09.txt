DNA sequencing is the basic workhorse of modern day biology and medicine.
Shotgun sequencing is the dominant technique used: many randomly located short
fragments called reads are extracted from the DNA sequence, and these reads are
assembled to reconstruct the original sequence. A basic question is: given a
sequencing technology and the statistics of the DNA sequence, what is the
minimum number of reads required for reliable reconstruction? This number
provides a fundamental limit to the performance of {\em any} assembly
algorithm. For a simple statistical model of the DNA sequence and the read
process, we show that the answer admits a critical phenomena in the asymptotic
limit of long DNA sequences: if the read length is below a threshold,
reconstruction is impossible no matter how many reads are observed, and if the
read length is above the threshold, having enough reads to cover the DNA
sequence is sufficient to reconstruct. The threshold is computed in terms of
the Renyi entropy rate of the DNA sequence. We also study the impact of noise
in the read process on the performance.
