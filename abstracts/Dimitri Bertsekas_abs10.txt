In this paper, we propose a new lower approximation scheme for POMDP with
discounted and average cost criterion. The approximating functions are
determined by their values at a finite number of belief points, and can be
computed efficiently using value iteration algorithms for finite-state MDP.
While for discounted problems several lower approximation schemes have been
proposed earlier, ours seems the first of its kind for average cost problems.
We focus primarily on the average cost case, and we show that the corresponding
approximation can be computed efficiently using multi-chain algorithms for
finite-state MDP. We give a preliminary analysis showing that regardless of the
existence of the optimal average cost J in the POMDP, the approximation
obtained is a lower bound of the liminf optimal average cost function, and can
also be used to calculate an upper bound on the limsup optimal average cost
function, as well as bounds on the cost of executing the stationary policy
associated with the approximation. Weshow the convergence of the cost
approximation, when the optimal average cost is constant and the optimal
differential cost is continuous.
