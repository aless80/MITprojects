We consider minimization of the sum of a large number of convex functions,
and we propose an incremental aggregated version of the proximal algorithm,
which bears similarity to the incremental aggregated gradient and subgradient
methods that have received a lot of recent attention. Under cost function
differentiability and strong convexity assumptions, we show linear convergence
for a sufficiently small constant stepsize. This result also applies to
distributed asynchronous variants of the method, involving bounded
interprocessor communication delays.
We then consider dual versions of incremental proximal algorithms, which are
incremental augmented Lagrangian methods for separable equality-constrained
optimization problems. Contrary to the standard augmented Lagrangian method,
these methods admit decomposition in the minimization of the augmented
Lagrangian, and update the multipliers far more frequently. Our incremental
aggregated augmented Lagrangian methods bear similarity to several known
decomposition algorithms, including the alternating direction method of
multipliers (ADMM) and more recent variations. We compare these methods in
terms of their properties, and highlight their potential advantages and
limitations.
We also address the solution of separable inequality-constrained optimization
problems through the use of nonquadratic augmented Lagrangiias such as the
exponential, and we dually consider a corresponding incremental aggregated
version of the proximal algorithm that uses nonquadratic regularization, such
as an entropy function. We finally propose a closely related linearly
convergent method for minimization of large differentiable sums subject to an
orthant constraint, which may be viewed as an incremental aggregated version of
the mirror descent method.
