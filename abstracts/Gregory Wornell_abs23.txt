We study the problem of generating a shared secret key between two terminals
in a joint source-channel setup -- the sender communicates to the receiver over
a discrete memoryless wiretap channel and additionally the terminals have
access to correlated discrete memoryless source sequences. We establish lower
and upper bounds on the secret-key capacity. These bounds coincide,
establishing the capacity, when the underlying channel consists of independent,
parallel and reversely degraded wiretap channels. In the lower bound, the
equivocation terms of the source and channel components are functionally
additive. The secret-key rate is maximized by optimally balancing the the
source and channel contributions. This tradeoff is illustrated in detail for
the Gaussian case where it is also shown that Gaussian codebooks achieve the
capacity. When the eavesdropper also observes a source sequence, the secret-key
capacity is established when the sources and channels of the eavesdropper are a
degraded version of the legitimate receiver. Finally the case when the
terminals also have access to a public discussion channel is studied. We
propose generating separate keys from the source and channel components and
establish the optimality of this approach when the when the channel outputs of
the receiver and the eavesdropper are conditionally independent given the
input.
