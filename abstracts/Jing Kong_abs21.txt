We demonstrate anisotropic etching of single-layer graphene by
thermally-activated nickel nanoparticles. Using this technique, we obtain
sub-10nm nanoribbons and other graphene nanostructures with edges aligned along
a single crystallographic direction. We observe a new catalytic channeling
behavior, whereby etched cuts do not intersect, resulting in continuously
connected geometries. Raman spectroscopy and electronic measurements show that
the quality of the graphene is resilient under the etching conditions,
indicating that this method may serve as a powerful technique to produce
graphene nanocircuits with well-defined crystallographic edges.
