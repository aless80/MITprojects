The spin Hall effect (SHE) generates spin currents within nonmagnetic
materials. Previously, studies of the SHE have been motivated primarily to
understand its fundamental origin and magnitude. Here we demonstrate, using
measurement and modeling, that in a Pt/Co bilayer with perpendicular magnetic
anisotropy the SHE can produce a spin transfer torque that is strong enough to
efficiently rotate and reversibly switch the Co magnetization, thereby
providing a new strategy both to understand the SHE and to manipulate magnets.
We suggest that the SHE torque can have a similarly strong influence on
current-driven magnetic domain wall motion in Pt/ferromagnet multilayers. We
estimate that in optimized devices the SHE torque can switch magnetic moments
using currents comparable to those in magnetic tunnel junctions operated by
conventional spin-torque switching, meaning that the SHE can enable magnetic
memory and logic devices with similar performance but simpler architecture than
the current state of the art.
