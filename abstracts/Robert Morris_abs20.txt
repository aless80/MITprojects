We present high precision photometry of Kepler-41, a giant planet in a 1.86
day orbit around a G6V star that was recently confirmed through radial velocity
measurements. We have developed a new method to confirm giant planets solely
from the photometric light curve, and we apply this method herein to Kepler-41
to establish the validity of this technique. We generate a full phase
photometric model by including the primary and secondary transits, ellipsoidal
variations, Doppler beaming and reflected/emitted light from the planet. Third
light contamination scenarios that can mimic a planetary transit signal are
simulated by injecting a full range of dilution values into the model, and we
re-fit each diluted light curve model to the light curve. The resulting
constraints on the maximum occultation depth and stellar density combined with
stellar evolution models rules out stellar blends and provides a measurement of
the planet's mass, size, and temperature. We expect about two dozen Kepler
giant planets can be confirmed via this method.
