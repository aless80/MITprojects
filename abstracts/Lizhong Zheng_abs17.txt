We consider a multiple-input, multiple-output (MIMO) wideband Rayleigh block
fading channel where the channel state is unknown to both the transmitter and
the receiver and there is only an average power constraint on the input. We
compute the capacity and analyze its dependence on coherence length, number of
antennas and receive signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) per degree of freedom. We
establish conditions on the coherence length and number of antennas for the
non-coherent channel to have a "near coherent" performance in the wideband
regime. We also propose a signaling scheme that is near-capacity achieving in
this regime.
We compute the error probability for this wideband non-coherent MIMO channel
and study its dependence on SNR, number of transmit and receive antennas and
coherence length. We show that error probability decays inversely with
coherence length and exponentially with the product of the number of transmit
and receive antennas. Moreover, channel outage dominates error probability in
the wideband regime. We also show that the critical as well as cut-off rates
are much smaller than channel capacity in this regime.
