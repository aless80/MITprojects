Recently, noncentrosymmetric superconductor BiPd has attracted considerable
research interest due to the possibility of hosting topological
superconductivity. Here we report a systematic high-resolution angle-resolved
photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and spin-resolved ARPES study of the normal
state electronic and spin properties of BiPd. Our experimental results show the
presence of a surface state at higher-binding energy with the location of Dirac
point at around 700 meV below the Fermi level. The detailed photon energy,
temperature-dependent and spin-resolved ARPES measurements complemented by our
first principles calculations demonstrate the existence of the spin polarized
surface states at high-binding energy. The absence of such spin-polarized
surface states near the Fermi level negates the possibility of a topological
superconducting behavior on the surface. Our direct experimental observation of
spin-polarized surface states in BiPd provides critical information that will
guide the future search for topological superconductivity in noncentrosymmetric
materials.
