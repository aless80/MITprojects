For many movement disorders, such as Parkinson's and ataxia, disease
progression is usually assessed visually by a clinician according to a
numerical rating scale, or using questionnaires. These tests are subjective,
time-consuming, and must be administered by a professional. We present an
automated method for quantifying the severity of motion impairment in patients
with ataxia, using only video recordings. We focus on videos of the
finger-to-nose test, a common movement task used to assess ataxia progression
during the course of routine clinical checkups.
Our method uses pose estimation and optical flow techniques to track the
motion of the patient's hand in a video recording. We extract features that
describe qualities of the motion such as speed and variation in performance.
Using labels provided by an expert clinician, we build a supervised learning
model that predicts severity according to the Brief Ataxia Rating Scale (BARS).
Our model achieves a mean absolute error of 0.363 on a 0-4 scale and a
prediction-label correlation of 0.835 in a leave-one-patient-out experiment.
The accuracy of our system is comparable to the reported inter-rater
correlation among clinicians assessing the finger-to-nose exam using a similar
ataxia rating scale. This work demonstrates the feasibility of using videos to
produce more objective and clinically useful measures of motor impairment.
