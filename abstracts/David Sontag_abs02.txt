This work presents a novel objective function for the unsupervised training
of neural network sentence encoders. It exploits signals from paragraph-level
discourse coherence to train these models to understand text. Our objective is
purely discriminative, allowing us to train models many times faster than was
possible under prior methods, and it yields models which perform well in
extrinsic evaluations.
