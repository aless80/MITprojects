We present the first sample-optimal sublinear time algorithms for the sparse
Discrete Fourier Transform over a two-dimensional sqrt{n} x sqrt{n} grid. Our
algorithms are analyzed for /average case/ signals. For signals whose spectrum
is exactly sparse, our algorithms use O(k) samples and run in O(k log k) time,
where k is the expected sparsity of the signal. For signals whose spectrum is
approximately sparse, our algorithm uses O(k log n) samples and runs in O(k
log^2 n) time; the latter algorithm works for k=Theta(sqrt{n}). The number of
samples used by our algorithms matches the known lower bounds for the
respective signal models.
By a known reduction, our algorithms give similar results for the
one-dimensional sparse Discrete Fourier Transform when n is a power of a small
composite number (e.g., n = 6^t).
