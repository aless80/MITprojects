We analyze the effect of tumor repopulation on optimal dose delivery in
radiation therapy. We are primarily motivated by accelerated tumor repopulation
towards the end of radiation treatment, which is believed to play a role in
treatment failure for some tumor sites. A dynamic programming framework is
developed to determine an optimal fractionation scheme based on a model of cell
kill due to radiation and tumor growth in between treatment days. We find that
faster tumor growth suggests shorter overall treatment duration. In addition,
the presence of accelerated repopulation suggests larger dose fractions later
in the treatment to compensate for the increased tumor proliferation. We prove
that the optimal dose fractions are increasing over time. Numerical simulations
indicate potential for improvement in treatment effectiveness.
