In a multiparty message-passing model of communication, there are $k$
players. Each player has a private input, and they communicate by sending
messages to one another over private channels. While this model has been used
extensively in distributed computing and in multiparty computation, lower
bounds on communication complexity in this model and related models have been
somewhat scarce. In recent work \cite{phillips12,woodruff12,woodruff13}, strong
lower bounds of the form $\Omega(n \cdot k)$ were obtained for several
functions in the message-passing model; however, a lower bound on the classical
Set Disjointness problem remained elusive.
In this paper, we prove tight lower bounds of the form $\Omega(n \cdot k)$
for the Set Disjointness problem in the message passing model. Our bounds are
obtained by developing information complexity tools in the message-passing
model, and then proving an information complexity lower bound for Set
Disjointness. As a corollary, we show a tight lower bound for the task
allocation problem \cite{DruckerKuhnOshman} via a reduction from Set
Disjointness.
